*I hesitated to write this post since I know it's a sensitive topic in local business communities. However, I believe strongly that startups should not do business plan contests, and we should be looking for a leaner replacement for today's software-driven startups.*

__Business Plan Contests are a waste of time for startups__

In a business plan contest, you draft large document laying out future projections and goals of your company, given a target business model in a target market. 

It's this huge work of art that took a ton of time to write and lays out a perfect plan for guaranteed success. The awesome thing is you can tweak it anyway you like, so the results at the end please you, your team, potential investors, and the judging panel.

__The problem is, it's all 100% complete and utter bullshit.__

In the time it took you to draft up a business plan you could have actually gone out and talked to customers. Hell, you could have sold them something, too!

That's really how businesses become successful: by building real traction with real customers. The great thing is you don't have to have a fucking clue what you are going to do if you actually get a customer, but just getting one teaches you a hell of a lot more than your BP would.

Oh, and forget about winning if you don't have a strong relationship with the judging panel. As in real life, BPC success is driven on relationships, not merit.

And what if you actually win the contest, it's all roses then right? 

Unfortunately, no. In most cases, the most you will win is $50k cash and extra services. That sounds great, and you can do a lot with $50k at a seed stage, but it doesn't really go a very long way once you start getting serious with your business. Instead, keep your day job and work on this on the side.

What about the services? I believe if you're free you're fucked. If you aren't legitimately paying out of pocket for legal, accounting, office space, etc. you really have no control and you are on the bottom of everyone's list. This means everything takes much longer to get done and in some cases you actually get overcharged and blow through your free budget.

__What should we do instead?__

Acclerators and incubators are the start of a trend to change the way we deal with young businesses. Instead of fantasizing and making future projections that aren't realistic, you __do work__. Go talk to people, see what problems they have, solve them, and have a value exchange.

These aren't the only alternatives. There are hackathons, Lean Startup meetups, and other groups focused on customer development.

If you look at what is happening in more advanced startup communities like SF and NY, absolutely no one ever talks about BPCs. There is a reason: they just don't make sense for most companies.

__Skip it and start working on building your fucking business instead of fantasizing about it.__

*What are your thoughts? Do you find BPCs valuable? Am I just plain wrong? Please leave a comment below.*
