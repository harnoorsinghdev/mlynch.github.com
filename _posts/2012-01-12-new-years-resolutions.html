    <p>This year I've decided to write down some resolutions I'd like to achieve, along with ways I can keep improving myself.</p>
<p />
<div><strong>Take More Risks</strong></div>
<p />
<div>I'm disappointed that last year I did not make big changes in my life when I felt they were appropriate, instead dwelling on the "what-ifs?" and doing what was easy. I'm trying to learn how to build my software product development career, and I'm learning when to move on and when to stick it out. I have to be okay with doing things that scare my parents and leave me with gaps in employment. Most of the people I look up to have lead lives that deviate from societal norms. This is the year for big changes and to stop worrying about the "what-ifs?"</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Express my Opinion More Often</strong></div>
<p />
<div>This year I want to let more of my personality out. I don't want to worry about being liked by everyone. In private I'm not a neutral person, and I don't think I have to lose my personality to gain traction in my career and business pursuits. &nbsp;As in product development, you never learn anything if you don't form an opinion and test it by getting it out to other people.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Be More Open to Cool Stuff</strong></div>
<p />
<div>I almost missed out on Fallout 3 due to a misconception I had about the game. &nbsp;Now it's one of my absolute favorites and I'm glad I gave it a shot. &nbsp;This year I want to be more aware of false impressions.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Think About Food</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Last year I tried going Vegan for several months. &nbsp;It was one of the best things I've ever done. &nbsp;I've gained staples that I can't live without, and I feel more enlightened about food, where it comes from, and the true costs of satisfying my conditioned American palate. This year I want to eat less meat, seafood, and dairy, and to support local farming by joining a CSA and spending more of my money at the farmer's market.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Think About Waste</strong></div>
<p />
<div>I generate a large amount of waste just by maintaining a busy lifestyle. &nbsp;This year I want to reduce my waste contributions. Driving less, eating fewer individually packaged foods, and conserving water are all possible ways to do this.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Write More Often</strong></div>
<p />
<div>I express myself more clearly in writing than speech, and my friends and family often enjoy the things I write about. &nbsp;This year I want to put more of my thoughts, ideas, dreams, opinions, and lessons learned into writing and to share them with the world. I want people to tell me I'm wrong and to help me become right. I want to share the things that have challenged my opinions and misconceptions, and hopefully help others challenge theirs.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Speak More</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Public speaking is something I've always been terrified of, and I feel like I don't accurately project who I am when I speak in foreign situations. Right now the worst part for me is the part in between saying "yes" to an engagement, and the second leading up to the presentation. &nbsp;I'm never nervous to say "yes," which is good because I should do it more this year.</div>
<p />
<p />
<div><strong>Be a Better Boyfriend</strong></div>
<p />
<div>My girlfriend and I live 90 miles apart. &nbsp;This year I want to close that gap and spend more time with her. &nbsp;She's more important to me than she realizes and I need to do a better job of showing that.</div>
