Going vegan was a very enlightening experience for me. There were a lot of things about my habits that I never realized required such elaborate animal-based systems, or used certain animal ingredients. For some people these realiziations might seem really elementary, but remember I grew up in a suburb of Milwaukee and had little rural experience.

I should preface this by saying that I'm not currently vegan, or vegetarian for that matter. I was never able to make it work, but I blame myself more than anything. Casting away twenty five years of American habits was a lot harder for me than I expected. But it's a process and I've grown from my first attempts.
