Going vegan was a very enlightening experience for me. There were a lot of things about my habits that I never realized required such elaborate animal-based systems, or used certain animal ingredients. For some people these realiziations might seem really elementary, but keep in mind I grew up in a suburb of Milwaukee and had little rural experience (my girlfriend calls me a "city boy" even).

I should preface this by saying that I'm not currently vegan, or vegetarian for that matter. I was never able to make it work, but I blame myself more than anything. Casting away twenty five years of American habits was a lot harder for me than I expected. But it's a process and I've grown from my first attempts, and will inevitably try again.

If you don't think very much about where your food, clothing, or even medicince comes from, hopefully this list of 10 things I learned by going vegan will help enlighten you a bit.

Milk comes from pregnant cows
-----------------------------

This is the one I'm most ashamed to admit, but I'm guessing most people don't truly understand what it means for milk to come from pregnant female cows. Sure, that sounds nice and happy, but it's really quite disturbing.

How do you produce milk year round? You have to keep the cow pregnant. Imagine being pregant all the time, until you die or can't get pregnant anymore and are slaughtered? And to ensure fertility and extended milk production time, hormones and other chemicals are used which often make it into the milk.

And that's just for females. What happens with the males that are born? A common thread in animal production is the males aren't useful to the task at hand, and have to be repurposed. Dairy calves also aren't bred for meat production so their future is uncertain: be raised for full beef production, be raised for veal production (more on that later), or be culled to save space.
