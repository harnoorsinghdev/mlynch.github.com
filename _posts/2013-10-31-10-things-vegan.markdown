Going vegan was a very enlightening experience for me. There were a lot of things about my habits that I never realized required such elaborate animal-based systems, or used certain animal ingredients. For some people these realizations might seem really elementary, but keep in mind I grew up in a close suburb of Milwaukee and had little rural experience (my girlfriend calls me a "city boy").

I should preface this by saying that I'm not currently vegan, or vegetarian for that matter. I was never able to make it work, but I blame myself more than anything. Casting away twenty five years of American habits was a lot harder for me than I expected. But it's a process and I've grown from my first attempts, and will inevitably try again.

If you don't think very much about where your food, clothing, or even medicine comes from, hopefully this list of 10 things I learned by going vegan will help enlighten you a bit. It's kind of like knowing the NSA is spying on us. Once you know, you can never really go back. You might not care, but at least you'll know (I'm not here to judge you on that, either).

1. Milk comes from pregnant cows
-------------------------------

This is the one I'm most ashamed to admit, but I'm guessing most people don't truly understand what it means for milk to come from pregnant female cows. Sure, that sounds nice and happy, but it's really quite disturbing.

How do you produce milk year round? You have to keep the cow pregnant. Imagine being pregnant all the time, until you die or can't get pregnant anymore and are slaughtered? And to ensure fertility and extended milk production time, hormones and other chemicals are used which [negatively affect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovine_somatotropin#Controversy) the cow and often make it into the milk.

And that's just for females. What happens with the males that are born? A common thread in animal production is the males aren't useful to the task at hand, and have to be repurposed. Dairy calves also aren't bred for meat production so their future is uncertain: be raised for full beef or leather production if the farm does that, be raised for veal production (more on that later), or be culled to save space.

Once I knew all of this, I realized how fucked up it is that the Milk industry is basically able to invade our public schools, under guise as a fundamental nutrition requirement, when really it was just a product that we could do without that actually had pretty big costs.

The Milk lobby is incredibly strong, and has successfully convinced our government to treat it as something more than just another product being sold. Think about that next time you see a "Got Milk?" advertisement.

2. Veal and Lamb are from babies
--------------------------------

I never really knew that Veal or Lamb came from the young cow and sheep, respectively. I don't think Veal is all that popular in America except in fancy restaurants, but Lamb is much more popular and one of my personal favorites.

To produce Veal, calves (baby cows) are often chained or restricted in their movement. This limits the production of connective tissue which is not desired in the meat.

I'm not too familiar with the Lamb production process, but I know many people would find it unsettling to know they are eating such a cute little creature.

Once I realized where Veal came from, I couldn't take any fancy restaurant that tried to serve Veal as a special seriously. Why would I want to go out of my way and spend more money for something I found pretty disturbing?

My guess is Veal will fall out of favor over time as more and more people understand what it really is, but that might be wishful thinking.

3. Eggs come from female Chickens
---------------------------------

Another one of those obvious things, but the reality is far from it. I think most people understand that the eggs we eat come from female chickens. More might know that chickens will continue to lay eggs each day when they are removed, with the goal of incubating one to maturity.

But how do we get more chickens to lay more eggs? That is where eggs start to become really problematic. So, we need females to lay eggs, but only 50% of chickens born are female. What happens with the males?

Unfortunately, a large quantity of the ones that are born male are culled immediately. Grinder style. Wikipedia has a lot more on the [Chick Culling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling) process. It's pretty grisly.

4. Many supplements have animal origins
----

This one is much harder to track, since vitamins and other supplements can be sourced from many different places. But often compounds that we supplement with are made from animal by-products.

I don't have as much to say about this but it was one of the things that surprised me. If you are curious, [http://veganwolf.com/animal_ingredients.htm](Vegan Wolf) is one site that lists various ingredients that may have animal origins, but I'm not sure how accurate it is.


5. Animal production consumes a massive amount of energy
-------

It's a little silly to think about how much food we grow just to feed animals so we can eat them. There was an "inefficiency alarm" that went off in my programmer brain when I first started thinking about this.

Not to mention Cows actually do product a measurable and impactful amount of methane and other greenhouse gasses just from being big burpers (and some by farting). This sounds silly but those animals are producing the molecules that contribute to global warming, and doing a lot of it.

Keeping animals alive requires a lot of water, food grown specifically for them (requiring even more resources), space to house and raise them, and energy to manage them (trucks, heat, etc.).

The energy to nutrition ratio is probably not anywhere near optimal. That alone bothers me.

6. Wool isn't vegan
-------------------

If you're starting to see a trend, it's that any product made from animals isn't vegan. However, I think people overlook Wool specifically since it seems so harmless. Sheep grow too much hair, and we're just cutting it for them and using a bit of it for ourselves. Totally cool, right?

The reality is being raised for your hair is just as problematic as anything else. First of all, domestic sheep "grow too much hair" because we selectively bred them for that.

And just like Chickens and Dairy cows, if you exist just to provide a by-product of your physical being, your life revolves around maximizing that product. Sheep are confined just like any animal, and the shearing process isn't always so painless or clean. 

I'll admit that I love SmartWool socks and Wool is definitely becoming hip again (though synthetics have had a big impact on the industry). Just think about the process of getting the Wool, and whether we could be using alternatives.

7. Eating fish is killing our oceans
----

I'll admit, I don't feel much disgust at killing and eating fish. I'm just not capable of feeling empathy for them, much like small insects.

But unlike domestic farm animals, the raising process isn't the issue with Fish and other sea creatures. It's the strain we are placing on the ecosystem that is really problematic.

Overfishing is hurting really sensitive aquatic ecosystems and popular species like Bluefin Tuna are seeing some of the worst of it. Some measures place almost a 90% reduction on Bluefin Tuna populations compared to their unfished levels.

Another issue is that regulating fishing is incredibly difficult, and every country treats the oceans differently. We have to work together to make changes, and that has never been easy.

Add to this the impact global warming is having on ocean ecosystems through acidification and other processes, and the ocean is facing some major challenges that it might not recover from.

8. Free range, etc. is a marketing term
----

Lately there has been a surge in more progressive food production, like free-range Chicken and grass-fed Beef. It sounds like an improvement from the big factory farms we are used to, and it does signal some positive changes in our mindset as consumers.

The problem is that these farms are businesses just like the big factory farms. They are probably addicted to growth just like any other business, and will make decisions to help them grow over time.

Unfortunately, decreasing per unit costs is incredibly important in a market that sells commodities. Being slightly more expensive is going to be harder as other brands match each other on these progressive elements, and the quality and dedication to values will slip.

That might be pessimistic, but the underlying reality is that the Animals are still the product even if the company is making it seem like they are just living their normal lives out on the range eating grass. It's just sugar coating to make you feel better, and it works.


9. Being vegetarian isn't enough
--------------------------------

This one is on here not to ridicule, but to explain that if you are going vegetarian in order to make a difference in the other things on this list, that it's not enough.

What I mean by that is often demand in one industry carries over to demand in another. Take leather, for example. By avoiding meat but consuming leather, you are actually placing demand indirectly on the meat industry. Since leather is a valuable by-product of meat production, demand for leather helps increase meat production.

Another example is egg consumption. By consuming eggs we are demanding farms to raise more female chickens which results in all the problems from #3. You can't pick and choose which part of the process to consume from, because each part relies on the others.

If you are vegetarian because you just don't like meat, that is one thing. If you are vegetarian because you think by not eating meat you are making a differience, I don't really believe that's true, unfortunately. But it's a step in the right direction and like I said, this is not ridicule but education.


10. The scales are massive
-------

Sometimes when I think about my non-vegan behaviors multiplied by the world's population, I feel a great sense of despair. Imagine every single person waking up today and having eggs for breakfast. Maybe they will have some beef for lunch, and some chicken for dinner. They wear leather, eat fish, and use medicine made from animals.

When it's just our plate we are looking at, it's easy to think that our choices aren't that important. But it's not about you or me, it's about our collective behaviors. We are all doing a lot of animal consumption all over the world, and it shows no signs of stopping or slowing down.

We consume animal products largely because we *prefer* them. We love the taste of meat. We love the quality of silk or wool. We are addicted to breakfast burritos (like me).  But there are alternatives, and their quality is increasing. While they, too, have costs, many of them are perhaps more future proof.

If I could get just two things out of this post for a non-vegan, it would be to think about everything you buy and whether there is a more lightweight alternative, and to look at veganism not as some hippie inclination, but a desire to find something that is collectively better for the earth, our animals, and our health.

That seems like a pretty noble pursuit to me.
