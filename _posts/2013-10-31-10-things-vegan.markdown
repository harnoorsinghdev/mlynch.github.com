Going vegan was a very enlightening experience for me. There were a lot of things about my habits that I never realized required such elaborate animal-based systems, or used certain animal ingredients. For some people these realiziations might seem really elementary, but keep in mind I grew up in a suburb of Milwaukee and had little rural experience (my girlfriend calls me a "city boy").

I should preface this by saying that I'm not currently vegan, or vegetarian for that matter. I was never able to make it work, but I blame myself more than anything. Casting away twenty five years of American habits was a lot harder for me than I expected. But it's a process and I've grown from my first attempts, and will inevitably try again.

If you don't think very much about where your food, clothing, or even medicince comes from, hopefully this list of 10 things I learned by going vegan will help enlighten you a bit. It's kind of like knowing the NSA is spying on us. Once you know, you can never really go back. You might not care, but at least you'll know (I'm not here to judge you on that, either).

Milk comes from pregnant cows
-----------------------------

This is the one I'm most ashamed to admit, but I'm guessing most people don't truly understand what it means for milk to come from pregnant female cows. Sure, that sounds nice and happy, but it's really quite disturbing.

How do you produce milk year round? You have to keep the cow pregnant. Imagine being pregant all the time, until you die or can't get pregnant anymore and are slaughtered? And to ensure fertility and extended milk production time, hormones and other chemicals are used which often make it into the milk.

And that's just for females. What happens with the males that are born? A common thread in animal production is the males aren't useful to the task at hand, and have to be repurposed. Dairy calves also aren't bred for meat production so their future is uncertain: be raised for full beef production if the farm does that, be raised for veal production (more on that later), or be culled to save space.

Veal and Lamb are from babies
-----------------------------

I never really knew that Veal or Lamb came from the young cow and sheep, respectively. I don't think Veal is all that popular in America except in fancy restaurants, but Lamb is much more popular and one of my personal favorites.

To produce Veal, calves (baby cows) are often chained or restricted in their movement. This limits the production of connective tissue which is not desired in the meat.

I'm not too familiar with the Lamb production process, but I know many people would find it unsettling to know they are eating such a cute little creature.

Once I realized where Veal came from, I couldn't take any fancy restaurant that tried to serve Veal as a special seriously. Why would I want to go out of my way and spend more money for something I found pretty disturbing?

My guess is Veal will fall out of favor over time as more and more people understand what it really is, but that might be wishful thinking.

Eggs come from female Chickens
------------------------------

Another one of those obvious things, but the reality is far from it. I think most people understand that the eggs we eat come from female chickens. More might know that chickens will continue to lay eggs when they are removed, with the goal of incubating one to maturity.

But how do we get more chickens to lay more eggs? That is where eggs start to become really problematic. So, we need females to lay eggs, but only 50% of chickens born are female. What happens with the males?

Unfortunately, a large quantity of the ones that are born male are culled immediately. Grinder style. Wikipedia has a lot more on the [Chick Culling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling) process.

Being vegetarian isn't enough
-----------------------------

This one is on here not to ridicule, but to explain that if you are going vegetarian in order to avoid other things on this list that repulse you, that it's not enough.

What I mean by that is often demand in one industry carries over to demand in another. Take leather, for example. By avoiding meat but consuming leather, you are actually placing demand indirectly on the meat industry. Since leather is a valuable by-product of meat production, demand for leather helps increase meat production.
