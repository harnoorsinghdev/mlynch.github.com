Tonight I was watching a [great interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmdiQcybhLw) with Austin Meyer, the creator of the popular [X-Plane](http://x-plane.com/) flight simulator.

Austin bootstrapped [Laminar Research](http://www.laminarresearch.com/), the company behind X-Plane, which has been around for at least two decades, and has contended with incredibly tough competition from [Microsoft Flight Simulator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator) that traditionally dominated the market.

But in 2012 Microsoft decided to launch a toned-down version of their popular Flight Simulator line called "Flight", which they promptly [cancelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight#Cancellation) .

The Wikipedia article on Flight has this to say about the cancellation: "Reviewers indicated that sales may have been slow due to competition from other products, such as X-Plane."

In the interview, when Austin is asked what the ultimate goal and dream of X-Plane is, he answers

> "I guess the only goal is to design the best flight simulator in the world that everybody wants to use to see what it's like to fly airplanes...And it's not a number of people, it's not a number of dollars in revenue, and it's not a number of people on the payroll. The only question is: can we make a flight simulator where when people fly it they say this is like flying a real airplane."

The cool thing about Austin is he's just a big aviation nerd. He would be working on X-Plane even if it wasn't a business, and that's what I really like about him: he proves individual passion can overpower large, entrenched competition and create a [fanatic](http://x-plane.org/) customer base (disclaimer: I am one of those aspiring flight sim fanatics).

Back when he started writing X-Plane he said

> "when I first started writing X-Plane I always assumed everyone would always fly Microsoft [Flight Simulator] and I would just write X-Plane for myself and I would be the only person on earth to actually fly it."

Tonight, Austin is my inspiration to create a company with products that come from the heart. If you focus on that, you just might beat your big, entrenched competitors and get to work on something you love at the same time.

Stay true, and stay the course.
