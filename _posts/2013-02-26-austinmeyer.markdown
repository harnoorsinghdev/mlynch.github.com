Tonight I was watching [an interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmdiQcybhLw) with Austin Meyer, the creator of the popular [X-Plane](http://x-plane.com/) flight simulator.

Austin has essentially bootstrapped a highly profitable software company with complex technology in the face of huge competitors, and over time has come out on top.

In the interview, when Austin is asked what the ultimate goal and dream of X-Plane is, he answers

> "I guess the only goal is to design the best flight simulator in the world that everybody wants to use to see what it's like to fly airplanes...And it's not a number of people, it's not a number of dollars in revenue, and it's not a number of people on the payroll. The only question is: can we make a flight simulator where when people fly it they say this is like flying a real airplane."

X-Plane has been around for at least a decade (maybe two), and has contended with some huge competition from [Microsoft Flight Simulator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator) that traditionally dominated the market.

But in 2012 Microsoft decided to launch a toned-down version of their popular Flight Simulator line called "Flight", which they promptly [cancelled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Flight#Cancellation) .

The Wikipedia article on Flight has this to say about the cancellation: "Reviewers indicated that sales may have been slow due to competition from other products, such as X-Plane."

When you work on something you love and your only goal is to make kick ass products that win on pure merit, that has to feel amazing.

Tonight, Austin is my inspiration to create great products that come from the heart. Stay true and stay the course.

Good night.
