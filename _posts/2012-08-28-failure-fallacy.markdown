9 in 10 startups fail...right?

You went big. Like *Facebook* big. Shit, *bigger* than Facebook big. You had a great social platform, lots of promise and maybe some rocket fuel from top investors...and *nothing*. The startup failed.

You analyze your failure and wonder what happend. Conclusion: the world just wasn't ready. But maybe the startup failed because it wasn't built on any sound economics. 

I'm sick of this. Startups don't have to fail in such large numbers. Why do we keep making the same mistakes? Why do we keep building yet another social product? If not even [Like a Little](http://lal.com/) which supposedly had a "virality index...higher than Facebook's in their fastest growth stage" could build a big social product, why do we keep thinking we'll be able to? Business is not a popularity contest, and this is not high school.

The best way to build a real business has not changed for centuries, and the formula is incredibly simple: _Make something people want, charge for it, and scale it up._

It's not easy. In fact, it's fucking *hard*. But we live in a time of unprecedented personal empowerment. Each and every one of us is capable of turning our passions into products and building sustainable businesses on them. You can't build a sustainable business without money, so why build a product that doesn't build revenue right in?

The great thing is, you can do this without having to jump into the deep end. Run some experiments on the side. Keep your day job. Build something while you still have an income stream. Work nights and weekends to make it happen.

It's time to ignore the startup failure statistic. Take it from 37signals: "Don't get fooled by the stats. Other people's failures are just that: other peoples failures. If other people can't market their product, it has nothing to do with you."

Get out there and *sell*.
