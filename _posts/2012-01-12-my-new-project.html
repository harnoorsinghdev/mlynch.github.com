    <p>For the last few months I've been working on a new startup I'm super excited about, called <a href="http://codiqa.com/">Codiqa</a>. &nbsp;Codiqa is a&nbsp;really fast and easy way to build jQuery Mobile apps. Just drag and drop jQuery Mobile components to your app and you're ready to go. Co-founding the project with me is one of my best friends, <a href="http://bensperry.com/">Ben Sperry</a>.</p>
<p />
<div>Codiqa is probably the 10th software product I've built since 2010. &nbsp;Some of those projects were just for fun, some of them were for hire, and one was a business venture I spent almost two years working on. &nbsp;Already, Codiqa feels different. &nbsp;Where getting people to use my products before was like pulling teeth, people are organically finding Codiqa, sharing it, and otherwise really interested in the product. We blew through a free $75 adwords card a few months ago and haven't spent &nbsp;a penny on ads since.</div>
<p />
<div>For me, Codiqa represents an upgrade in my own maturity. &nbsp;The software I've written is simpler, easier to maintain, easier to measure, and easier to build on. &nbsp;I've made sure to track any data I can, and invest time into analyzing that data. I'm more proactive and confident about selling Codiqa to other people (one of my weaker points), and I'm more patient with its growth (also one of my weaker points).</div>
<p />
<div>Ben and I have become&nbsp;better at keeping things simple and spending more time engaging our users and getting our products into their hands. Where before we would over-design and over-develop before we ever got feedback from users, now we are okay saying "no" and letting people see something we wouldn't previously have been proud of. &nbsp;Codiqa has proven to us the value of staying fresh in people's minds, and putting down Photoshop or Vim in order to reconnect with them.</div>
<p />
<div>My dream with Codiqa is to turn it into a profitable small business and have Ben and I retain full ownership of the company. I think I've become idealistic in this dream. &nbsp; I want to be my own boss, and feel the energy of going in to work on my own creations all day. &nbsp;I want to make it successful, to celebrate the ups and feel the downs. I want to create my own work spaces and prioritize the things that I find valuable each day. I want to make our customers happy and make a real impact in their lives. I want to surround myself with creative, passionate people who <em>live</em> what they do. I want to do whatever the hell I want without someone having to approve it.</div>
<p />
<div>It's not a "lifestyle" business, it's what a normal business looks like. &nbsp;It's not sexy, and it's not trending all over TechCrunch. It's not easy, but it's possible.</div>
<p />
<div>The next few months will be interesting for Codiqa. &nbsp;We are going to make more time to work on it, and we will be testing more of our assumptions about the product. &nbsp;Already Codiqa has brought in more amazing opportunities than I've seen since graduating college, and we can't wait to fully take advantage of them.</div>
