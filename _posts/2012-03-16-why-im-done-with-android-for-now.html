    <p>I've been meaning to write this post for almost a year now, usually right after a frustrating experience with my Motorola Atrix running some version of Gingerbread. &nbsp;Instead of writing about a few issues, I figured I'd just make a bulleted list about why I'm done with Android and will be buying an iPhone again once I'm eligible for an upgrade. &nbsp;I don't want this post to come off as a hate-fest. I enjoy Android just fine and I want to see Android succeed in the long-term, but I hesitate to spend $200 and two years of my life dedicated to the platform at this time.</p>
<div>
<div>Here is a non-comprehensive list of reasons I'm done with Android for the time being:</div>
<p />
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>$200 worth of iPhone is a much better value than $200 worth of poor hardware design: flimsy plastic, bad battery life, and awkward screen dimmer switches.&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Manufacturer meddling and "improvements" over the default android distro. This is a huge problem for Android and might be fixed with Ice Cream Sandwhich.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ugly design: Motorola or AT&amp;T took the default android theme and created an ugly cyan (my least favorite color) theme.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I had to install multiple custom applications to reset manufacturer home screen changes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>YellowBooks came pre-installed on my phone.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Motoblur is some kind of Motorola account management application that clearly is baked into the phone and replaces better default functionality</strong></li>
<li><strong>AT&amp;T's death-star looking globe is now my browser icon, not the default one.</strong></li>
<li><strong>No built-in PDF or .doc viewer!</strong></li>
<li><strong>Segmented accounts. I now have two accounts that have apps "owned" by them. I have to view the market as each account to download updates</strong></li>
<li><strong>Android stores various google and twitter accounts tied to the device. This results in odd behavior like the market being "owned" by that account.</strong></li>
<li><strong>No good email or SMS clients. Must resort to K-9 mail which fetches mail slowly and has odd bugs, and Handcent which looks bad and does not have great UX design.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ice Cream Sandwich, what's that? Motorola or AT&amp;T tells me when I can upgrade to the Android version I heard about last year. It might as well not exist for me.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The alarm popup snoozes based on a single miss tap. It rotates as you pick it up to slide a tiny slider over to clear it. Usually results in annoying alarm 5 minutes after you've woken up.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The small delete icon for closing open browser windows often just triggers a tap on the list item below it, opening that window.</strong></li>
<li><strong>I can only have 10 browser windows open, managing them is a pain.</strong></li>
<li><strong>"Open with application" redirect loops: sometimes executing an intent results in a loop where I'm asked over and over which application I'd like to use to handle this intent.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dialer program (possibly replaced by Motorola) has really frustrating UX design. Seems to call back the last person you called when you click the dial button, rather than the last number it shows (could be a missed call, for example).</strong></li>
<li><strong>My android doesn't look like your android. Have to search in order to find ways to add cool stuff from your version to mine.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Can't see a list of running programs. Have to use Advanced Task Killer to reliably kill background apps</strong></li>
<li><strong>Random apps start without my authorization. Skype is particularly bad about this, as soon as I kill it, it's back running again.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div>This is a growing list. &nbsp;I'd love feedback on this list. Am I missing something? Am I being too harsh? I know iOS isn't perfect, but it's better than this. I'd love your comments!</div>
