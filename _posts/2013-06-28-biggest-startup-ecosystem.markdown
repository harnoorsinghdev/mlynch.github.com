I love the Bay Area. It's full of smart, innovative, and progressive people doing really interesting things. It's largely considered the biggest startup ecosystem in the world.

But that's wrong. The biggest startup ecosystem doesn't have a physical location.

The biggest startup ecosystem is the internet.
