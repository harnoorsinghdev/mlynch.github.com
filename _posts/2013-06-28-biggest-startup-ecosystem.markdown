I love the Bay Area. It's full of smart, innovative, and progressive people doing really interesting things. It's largely considered the biggest startup ecosystem in the world, the best place to Start a Startup.

But that's wrong.

The biggest startup ecosystem doesn't have a physical location. It doesn't have a government, or a diversity problem, or immigration issues, or high costs of living.

It doesn't have a morning commute, or even a single language.

The biggest startup ecosystem is the internet.

I live in Madison, Wisconsin, far from the Bay Area. Madison is a small city in the midwest that is high but still low on the startup ecosystem ratings list. There are some startups here, but the number of them is quite a bit less than the top five cities.

People tell me I seem like a proud Madisonion, that I want Madison to dominate in the future more than anything else. That I live here because I like being an underdog and want to be a part of creating a new community here.

But that is also wrong. I largely don't care about Madison, or Wisconsin, or the Bay Area, or America for that matter. Why limit myself to a physical location that is near to where my family planted roots, and becoming decreasingly differentiated from other great places to live that aren't even on this continent?

The most exciting things are happening online.

It always surprises me when I meet smart people in tech that seem physically dependent. Isn't the dream that we connect with people from all over the world, to do great things and transcend our physical limitations?

Ask yourself whether you want to be tied down, just another citizen of a country that [doesn't respect technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)) as much as we do. A country that has a too-recent history of disrespecting human rights. A country that finds every loophole it can to do more in a world that needs less of them.
