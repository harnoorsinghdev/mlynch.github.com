I love the Bay Area. It's full of smart, innovative, and progressive people doing really interesting things. It's largely considered the biggest startup ecosystem in the world, the best place to Start a Startup.

But that's wrong. The biggest startup ecosystem doesn't have a physical location. It doesn't have a single government, or a diversity problem, or immigration issues, or high costs of living.

The biggest startup ecosystem is the internet.

I don't live in the Bay Area, but I've almost moved there several times.

I live in Madison, Wisconsin. A small city in the midwest that is high but still low on the startup ecosystem ratings list.

People tell me I seem like a proud Madisonion. That I want Madison to dominate in the future more than anything else.

That is also wrong. I largely don't care about Madison, or America really. Why limit myself to a physical location that is near to where my family planted roots?
