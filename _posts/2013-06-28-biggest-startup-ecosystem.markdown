I love the Bay Area. It's full of smart, innovative, and progressive people doing really interesting things. It's largely considered the biggest startup ecosystem in the world, the best place to Start a Startup.

But that's wrong. The biggest startup ecosystem doesn't have a physical location. It doesn't have a single government, or a diversity problem, or immigration issues, or high costs of living.

The biggest startup ecosystem is the internet.

I don't live in the Bay Area, though I've almost moved there several times due to jobs and acquisitions.

I live in Madison, Wisconsin. A small city in the midwest that is high but still low on the startup ecosystem ratings list. There are some startups here, but the number of them is quite a bit less than the top five cities.

People tell me I seem like a proud Madisonion, that I want Madison to dominate in the future more than anything else.

That is also wrong. I largely don't care about Madison, or Wisconsin, or the Bay Area, or America for that matter. Why limit myself to a physical location that is near to where my family planted roots, and becoming decreasingly differentiated from other great places to live? 

The most exciting stuff in tech and beyond is happening online.

It always surprises me when I meet smart people in tech that seem physically dependent. Isn't the dream that we connect with people from all over the world, to do great things and transcend our physical limitations?

Ask yourself whether you want to be tied down, just another citizen of a country that [doesn't respect technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)) as much as we do.
