I've recently come to the conclusion that [Drifty](http://drifty.com/) is more studio than startup. More creative agency than a typical tech company.

The difference from a typical advertising agency or creative company is we aren't building products for clients, we are building them for customers. In fact, we almost always eschew consulting or contract work because it doesn't scale and we hate doing it.

Realizing this has been one of the most important things for Drifty, because it impacts the way we make some of the most important decisions a company can make. Specifically, it brings much more clarity to the way we deal with things like financing, partnerships, and investors.

When you are a studio, you think as if your products are your companies, and you probably have more than one. For us, we have three "companies": [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/), [Codiqa](http://codiqa.com/), and [Jetstrap](http://jetstrap.com/).

Of course, we are still a small team, and that's a lot of things to have to focus on. So one evolution we've made recently is that we will focus on a core space of the market and then build multiple smaller products on top. For us, that's HTML5 on mobile.
