I've recently come to the conclusion that Drifty is more studio than startup. The difference from a typical advertising agency or creative company is we aren't building products for clients, we are building them for customers.

Realizing this has been one of the most important things for Drifty, because it impacts the way we make some of the most important decisions a company can make.

Specifically, it brings much more clarity to the way we deal with things like financing, partnerships, and investors.
