I've recently come to the conclusion that [Drifty](http://drifty.com/) is more studio than startup. More creative agency than a typical tech company.

The difference from a typical advertising agency or creative company is we aren't building products for clients, we are building them for customers. In fact, we almost always eschew consulting or contract work because it doesn't scale and we hate doing it.

Realizing this has been one of the most important things for Drifty, because it impacts the way we make some of the most important decisions a company can make. Specifically, it brings much more clarity to the way we deal with things like financing, partnerships, and investors.

When you are a studio, you think as if your products are your companies, and you probably have more than one. For us, we have three "companies": [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/), [Codiqa](http://codiqa.com/), and [Jetstrap](http://jetstrap.com/).

Of course, we are still a small team, and that's a lot of things to have to focus on. So one evolution we've made recently is that we will focus on a core space of the market and then build multiple smaller products on top, ensuring that everything new we create can be utilized by our existing products and services. For us, that space is HTML5 mobile development.

I think it's helpful to use examples of other "studio" style tech companies to help understand the way we look at Drifty. One great one is [Obvious Corp](https://medium.com/obvious/7e542c703a7e) co-founded by Evan Williams of Twitter. To them, "Obvious is more of a philosophy than a company or product. We focus our long term view on ideas and technology that can be generally described as 'world positive.'"

When you have a great team of people who work really well together, you start to avoid things that could come in the way of that. For us, that meant not pursuing typical seed and series A financing for the company, fearing it would ruin our chances of staying together and building amazing products in mobile over the coming decade. Investors need their return, after all.

One downside to studios over startups is the general public finds them less interesting. To avoid that, we try to promote the products themselves as the "startup", and we keep a comparatively low profile for the Drifty brand. That is one evolution to earlier this year when we pushed Drifty as its own thing. Sometimes people think we are "Codiqa" as the company which is kind of confusing, but it's a tradeoff.
