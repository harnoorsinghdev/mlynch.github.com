A couple months ago, [my company](http://drifty.com/) raised its [first round of VC money](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/10/drifty-makers-of-the-ionic-mobile-framework-raise-1-million/).

I've [never](http://blog.drifty.com/2013/09/you-dont-get-our-bootstrapped-company/) [been](http://blog.codiqa.com/2012/03/from-yc-rejection-to-10000-users-in-1-month/) [quiet](http://blog.drifty.com/2013/04/bootstrapping-is-hacking/) about how Drifty bootstrapped its way for the first two years. In fact, I've been downright anti-investor for years. So when we announced the raise, a lot of people were perplexed.

After we launched our new project [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) in late 2013, we realized we had something that could be really huge on our hands, but had a different business model than our previous products (in this case, open source).

We knew the big vision with Ionic would be a feat of engineering, and we didn't want to have to worry about money. Not only that, but we didn't want our employees to have to worry about money, either.

As I reflected on how the company and our values had evolved over the last two years, I realized bootstrapping was never actually the goal, *maximizing our options* was.

When we raised our round, we already had nice revenue coming in. And even though our product plans were changing, we had proved developers wanted to be a part of our new vision with [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/). We were able to get great investors, not have to raise too much, and do it in less than one month so we could get back to work.

The reality is for most early-stage startups without meangingful traction or cash flow, investment is a bad deal. The investors are inexperienced and overbearing, the time it takes to raise is too long for too little, and the chance for negative impact before you really figure out what you are doing is too high.

Too many companies make deals before they have any leverage. Bootstrapping is all about increasing your leverage.

The funny thing is with the funding market being what it is, bootstrapping is almost a necessity. Investors are realizing they don't want to put money into companies that haven't even proved their ability to build, market, and make money from software.

If you do happen to convince an early stage investor to put money into your business before you have any product or traction, you aren't bootstrapping, and you probably just took a bad deal.

Go build your product, start spreading the word, and prove you can actually build and get something off the ground. Then figure out the financing part.

And never stop bootstrapping.
