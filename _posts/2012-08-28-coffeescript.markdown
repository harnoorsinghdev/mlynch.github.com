I'm officially obsessed with CoffeeScript.

The language feels so unique: practical, yet non-commercial or standards-laden. Clearly the language was designed in a way that felt right to Jeremy Ashkenas, and it just so happens it feels right to lots of other people, too.

In a decade of building software I have not used a language that is of such high quality yet so informal. It's a joy to use and I regret to say I doubted it for so long.

I'm a believer now and I hope to encourage *every* Javascript developer to spend some time with it. Use it on some new code. You'll absolutely love it if you give it time.
