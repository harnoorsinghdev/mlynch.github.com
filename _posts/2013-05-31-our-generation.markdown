Much has been written on my generation: the Millennials or Generation Y. While I don't want to belabor the point, I do think it's helpful to reiterate the prevelance of certain trends drawn from personal experience.

From observations I've made from the values of my close friend circle, the value of my larger extended network, consensus of emerging social networks, and my own personal values, my generation:


* Is largely non-religious, either Atheist, Agnostic, or apathetic. While many of them still feel the pull of something greater than themselves, fewer of them attribute it to classical religious ideas.

Going deeper, many find organized religion reprehensible, and outdated. This is largely because the few interactions our generation has with followers of traditional religion involve meddling in free expression of love and of course sexual assault and crime.

That being said, we still are struggling to find a way to detach the social services churches provide and make them a non-secular part of society. Taxation that embodies those values seems to be highly desired.

* Thinks LGBTQ is perfectly fine and *normal*. It's embraced largely as a show of support, but most of us wish it was a non-issue. We just want everyone to be happy and find love.

* Is very permissive about Marijuana usage. It might as well be legal based on pervasive attitudes, except for the fact that it's not. This generation wants Marijuana to be legal.

* Lives on the internet. And I don't just mean they spend every waking hour on it, but they actually *live* there. They socialize, exchange information, work, "commute," etc. on the web.

* Wants happiness more than money. Money can buy posessions such as cars, houses
