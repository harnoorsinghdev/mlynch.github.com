It just dawned on me that TV has always just been a shitty substitute.

Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to watch airplanes fly, snowboarders session a backcountry kicker, and Premier League players score amazing goals. TV would give me that...sometimes.  If I checked the TV guide months in advance, marked my calendar, and remembered to watch that day, I'd get a little fix for my passions.

The problem is that I *always* wanted more. A different camera angle, no commentary, a different aircraft. I couldn't get any of this from the TV. I had to accept whatever I was given and be happy.

That is, until YouTube came around. Now, I can get excited about something and steep in awesome videos of it. I can learn amazing things, experience real-life implementations, and share it with my friends. Best of all, I can do it on my own time and on my own curated topics.

In that way, TV has always been a shitty substitute for YouTube and its ilk. This isn't news to anyone, but what might be is the negative experiences we've had with our TVs. The lack of control. The lack of niche content. And the lack of programming that challenged our world views and showed us amazing new things.

TV as a content platform is dying. I don't think there's anything the old guard can do at this point to save it. It just wasn't what we ever actually wanted, just all we could have.
