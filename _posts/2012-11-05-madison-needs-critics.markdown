I was down in San Antonio, TX this weekend hanging out with some local tech people. One thing that struck me was how publicly critical everyone was of San Antonio.

Comparisons are constantly made between Austin and San Antonio. SA is just the lame brother of Austin, and everyone accepts it. But at the same time, they realize that there is a bright future for the city and they want to be a part of it, they just aren't going to let it continue to be lame by ignoring the warts.

San Antonio isn't the only town with an intensely critical citizenry. Those living in San Francisco seem to be the most critical I've encountered anywhere. Ask anyone living in SF their opinion of the place, and they will give you a pretty honest answer, complete with descriptions of the great and really not so great parts.

Part of this is SF is a city of transplants. Many people "love" their old town but moved to SF for greater opportunities, or to live with more people their own age, or to escape cultural problems back home. 

As SF is a popular destination, there isn't really any need to defend it. But it's partly this raw criticism and honesty that draws younger generations to it.

All this made me realize that Madison needs harsher critics too. It's almost a sin to talk poorly of this city, for fear it would damage our burgeoning community and tech scene.

I should be able to share my problems with Madison without fear that I'll be labeled "anti-Madison," someone working against the great progress this city has seen and will continue to see.

We need to stop being so sensitive about our small town and more focused on how to improve it. We should also stop writing purely glowing articles about Madison, it deserves better. It's far from perfect, and to pretend otherwise is just delusional.

Let's get back to working to build a great city with a realistic and objective attitude.

I love you Madison!
