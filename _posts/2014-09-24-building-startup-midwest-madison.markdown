I'm currently sitting in SFO waiting for a flight back home to Madison, and whenever I'm here I always find myself juxtaposing this place with Madison and the midwest in general. Today I thought it would be fun to reflect on what being in Madison has meant for [our company](http://drifty.com/), both the good and the bad, along with ways the Midwest is changing when it comes to startups.

In the process, I want to dispell (or not!) several myths about starting a startup in the midwest, as well as touch on some challenges and opportunities I believe startups have in the midwest, though through the lens of doing it in Madison (so some of this doesn't apply to other midwest cities like MSP or Chicago, but most of it does).

As a quick background, I stuck around Madison after graduating from the UW Computer Sciences department in 2010. I found a [great job](http://perblue.com/) building MMORPG games right in town and learned a ton. But I also knew I wanted to start my own company. My best friend and I left that job and started what became [Drifty](http://drifty.com/) in Madison in 2012.

Today Drifty is growing quickly, and our [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) is one of the top 75 most popular open source projects in the world, with over 170,000 apps created since February 2014 from developers all around the world.

This is an insight to our experience growing that company in Madison, WI.

## Myth #1: There is no money here

This one is 100% false. The more accurate statement is there is little to no money here for companies that aren't ready for it, or from firms that shouldn't be investing in startups as they can't handle the risk.

When it comes to early stage, I can name many VC/seed firms, including [Arthur Ventures](http://arthurventures.com/) (our investors, one is Chairman of the Board at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com)), [4490](http://4490.ventures/), [Chicago Ventures](http://www.chicagoventures.com/), [Hyde Park Venture Partners](http://www.hydeparkvp.com/), [Venture Investors](http://www.ventureinvestors.com/), [AmFam Ventures](http://www.amfamventures.com/), [Gener8tor](http://www.gener8tor.com/), [TechStars](http://techstars.com/), [Drive Capital](http://www.drivecapital.com/) (started by ex-Sequoia VCs), [Lightbank](http://www.lightbank.com/) (ever heard of Groupon?), and several more I know I'm missing.

Having spoken to everyone on this list, I am constantly impressed by how well they "get it," and I have many people on this list to thank for helping us fundraise and build our network. I hope I can give back to them in some way in the future.

Then, of course, there are the angels and Angel Groups. Though unfortunately my conclusion with Wisconsin Angel Groups is to avoid them as the pain-to-capital ratio appears to be rather bad (ask anyone that has pitched or raised from one and you'll hear something similar most likely).

Beyond the midwest firms, we are starting to see coastal firms like [Great Oaks](http://www.greatoaksvc.com/) focusing on the midwest (with investments in Madison firms like [EatStreet](http://eatstreet.com/) and [Fetch Rewards](http://www.fetchrewards.com/)), and even top-tier firms like Benchmark are [investing](http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/duo-security-12m-benchmark/?ncid=rss&utm_content=buffer3fa51&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) in the midwest.

The reality is there just aren't as many companies here period, and even fewer that are ready for VC dollars, so sometimes it seems like you are at a huge disadvantage when it comes to fundraising here. But I actually think the VC ecosystem in the Midwest is capable of supporting many more companies than we currently have, so you can stand out a bit more.

These days traction trumps everything, and if you are a good company that fits the VC mold you can have your pick of investors no matter where you are located.

## Myth #2: Fundraising takes much longer here

This is also false...unless you are chasing Angel Groups. Then yes, it will take longer and your company might very well die before you ever hear a "yes" (okay, I relent!).

When we [raised](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/10/drifty-makers-of-the-ionic-mobile-framework-raise-1-million/) our $1M seed round from Arthur Ventures it was done from initial meeting to cash-in-the-bank in under a month. I think only the fundraising fervor on Y Combinator's demo day could beat that!

There are ways to speed up a round, too. We did a YC [Safe Note](http://www.ycombinator.com/documents/#safe) which is like a convertible note without the debt part.  While the [verdict is still out](http://www.inc.com/mark-suster/bad-notes-on-venture-capital.html) on notes, for us it worked well and many coastal firms have experience with this type of financing. I give props to Arthur Ventures for being open to it even though it's very new in the Midwest.

Doing a priced round might slow things down and cost more money, but [Mark Suster](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/) doesn't agree and he knows lifetimes more about it than I do so take this with a grain of salt.

I think the key takeaway here is to learn how to fundraise well. It's something I'm learning every single day, but there is a big difference between making fundraising your [full time job](http://paulgraham.com/fr.html) and just dipping your toes in. Be aware that hating fundraising is actually a really good thing, and you should give into that hate by Getting It Done.

Unfortunately, I see too many Madison startups focusing only on raising local money, and not really making it a full time job. In Wisconsin proper there just aren't a ton of options and the ones that are here will move very slowly. It's simple to expand the search to the surrounding areas and the coasts though it will eat up (probably the CEO's) time, so get it done and move on.

It also helps a ton to build relationships with other founders and advisors who can make intros for you. Cold emailing a bunch of firms isn't really going to work, and if you feel like that's your only option perhaps you should be spending time building relationships first, or increasing your traction and visibility ("accelerators" are a good way to do that quickly).

If you want to pursue investment from the coasts and are actively fundraising, a common strategy I've seen and may or may not be actively engaging in is to do one week in SF, one week home. Line up a bunch of intros at first, jam meetings into a week, come back to reflect and do it again. Maybe I'll write more about this later.

## Myth #3: You miss out on everything

Depending on your market, it might feel like midwestern startups miss out on all the stuff going on in their market. For example, we are a developer company, and SF has a lot more developers there than here.

When I've been in Madison for long stretches of time without traveling, I get depressed. I feel like we are making a mistake being here and we are missing out on partnership opportunities, chances to evangelize our product, and relationships we could be building with investors.

But then I come to SF (which I've been doing more and more often) and meet with lots of customers, partners, friends, and investors, and I'm constantly surprised at how connected we've been to SF without living there. I left a partnership meeting this week wondering why our competitor just down the street in SF wasn't even part of the discussion. People in SF are a lot more open to building relationships with people outside of SF than midwesterners realize.

I always come back happy that we aren't based there but have invested in growing relationships there.

Our company has been fortunate to work with some of the biggest names in tech, like [Google](http://google.com/), [Zend](http://zend.com/) and [Red Gate](http://red-gate.com/), and we have great relationships with companies like [Salesforce](http://salesforce.com/), [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), and [Adobe](http://adobe.com/).

All from the comforts of our midwestern internet connection, and all by putting out great software people want to use and actively engaging outside of Madison.

## Myth #4: People don't want to live here

It's true that many people fear the cold in the midwest. And I'll be honest, when the trees are barren and the first snow turns hard as a rock and the temperatures are below 0 and you're scraping ice off your windshield, I'd rather be anywhere than here.

But I've calmed down a bit about this because I realized most cities in American have negative seasonal changes and other natural factors. For example, the Texas heat isn't really for me.

When you add in all the other great stuff, like beautiful parks and lakes, the abundance of fresh water, lack of pollution, relative density of major population centers (i.e. family nearby), quality of schools, and affordability, Madison and the midwest become pretty great places to live for a lot of people.

One of the advantages we have in Madison is that people with families want to live here, which might very well correlate with employees a bit further along in their career with more experience.

We've relocated people to Madison to work for us, and we are always amazed when potential hires from the bay area with ties to the midwest are eager to move back.

## Myth #5: Startups don't pay well here

This is a bit of a truth and a myth in one. It's largely true that companies here have been cheap when it comes to compensation, but that's due to a historical lack of competition and a lack of foresight.

With engineering-heavy teams, competition is global. People are working from the comforts of their home at well funded companies around the world. You have to compete with these companies whether you like it or not. I sometimes joke that Madison is like SF's remote office by how many engineers here work remotely for companies there.

But there have also been some other positive changes in costs for building a startup. For example, few startups need to or should buy or host their own server hardware. That can dramatically cut costs and make you more flexible as you grow.

As such, I'm seeing compensation for engineers going up in Madison. I'd like to think Drifty is competitive not just locally but also around the country. It's a source of pride for me and I want to continue to be a leader there.

## Truth #1: Office space sucks in Madison

This is one I believe will hurt Madison's startup growth over time, though I don't hear it brought up very often.

Madison is a much smaller city than SF, and it did not have the same history of growth that brought all the beautiful old buildings to downtown SF (though Milwaukee and Chicago *do* have these great old buildings). If you ignore the sketchy earthquake threat these buildings face, you see a lot more room for startups that are increasingly based in urban areas to grow rather large teams.

We just moved into a new office in the heart of downtown Madison. And while we love it, it's smaller than I'd like. Finding a space big enough that had any semblence of character was really hard. And being based on the far east or west side where there is a lot more space was not an option for us.

Of course, if you're willing to do custom build-outs to fix all the whacky government and law firm design decisions, you can be more flexible, but that does not fix the square footage constraint.

How we fix this in Madison is through legislation (or *lack thereof* in this case). With the space crunch on the isthmus combined with [building height restrictions](http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/mike_ivey/by-design-madison-has-no-tall-buildings/article_64e73570-b5e1-11e3-9e53-0019bb2963f4.html) from the capitol, it seems the only way we will be able to expand the city is by increasing our sprawl. This is why I am passionate about abolishing the building height restriction.

Oh, and don't get me started on the 3-year lease insistence. Good luck finding anything shorter than that beyond sublets and shared working spaces. I think that will change with increased startup activity and related turnover.

## Truth #2: Office *prices* are great here

Let's just say when I tell people how little we are paying for our new office that we did a custom build out on, my SF friends can't believe it.

Relatively speaking, office space is dirt cheap in Madison. And I wonder what cultural impact the insane office prices in SF have on young startups that are forced to work out of shared space for a lot longer.

## Truth #3: It's lonely here

This is a tough problem, because running a startup is already hard enough that adding in the relative lack of peer support in Madison makes it even harder.

I think founders in the midwest have the benefit and curse of focus. It's really easy to focus here because there aren't that many external distractions, but the downside is you get stuck in your bubble and stop getting feedback or a chance to just rant with anyone outside of the company.

We also tend to work too much. When people say SF startups don't have any work life balance, I laugh because I've found midwestern companies have even *less* work life balance (though I'd like to think Drifty is good here!). I think this is a combination of work ethic, lack of noise, and boredom in colder months.

But, like most things, this is something that can be fixed if it's identified. You can force yourself to stop working to meet with another founder, you can form great relationships with other founders around the country (Twitter is great for that), or you can try to make more friends outside of work (this is something I'm trying to be better about).

I think it's also important to spend time with founders that are at the same stage as you dealing with similar problems. If those people aren't in your same city, you have to look elsewhere.

## Truth #4: "Experience" is hard to find here

Sometimes you just need to hire people who have done it before, and that pain is felt particularly hard in the marketing, growth, sales, and operations side, especially for companies where the target market is not a traditional focus of local industry.

While Madison is wonderful for hiring great developers, the reality is Software-as-a-Service, developer tools, and consumer apps are new to the area. It's hard to find a "Director of Growth" here, and that seems to be a common problem for companies in the midwest.

What I'm seeing other companies doing is expanding to the coasts and adding offices there. I think this is what we will also end up doing as we grow. But it's not without its own challenges.

This will change over time as this generation of Madison companies trains the local talent pool and learns how to build companies in this Brave New Digital World.

## Truth #5: Traveling sucks from Madison

MSN is the airport I depart out of the most. I refuse to drive to Milwaukee or Chicago to catch a flight, though I'm sometimes tempted.

It sucks not being able to fly to SF direct. It adds at least 2-3 hours on the flight if you count the layovers and the time on the tarmac. If you miss a connection getting back home that day can be impossible (turns out this day almost ended like that, got my connection with 10 minutes to spare!). Not to mention tickets from/to MSN to/from SFO are almost always at least $450+.

There is a monetary, time, and sanity cost to traveling to and from Madison.

MSN seriously needs to get an SFO direct.

## Conclusion

Adding up all the challenges and the opportunities, I am more confident than ever that Drifty will grow at least our engineering and product teams in Madison. We benefit from the close connection to the university, and also the much more sane living costs that bring experienced people back to raise a family.

I'm starting to see Madison as a bit of a secret weapon for us: we can focus, we don't have to compete nearly as hard for hiring, and we are still well connected to the rest of the world.

But as a Madison and midwest-based company, we have to play to our strengths. We are best served by building companies that don't rely on specific geographical factors. We should become experts at tools like Twitter to reach people around the world for free. We need to become better at using technology to expand our ability to provide value around the world.

If we do that, we can turn Madison from just a great place to live into a great place to work and build the important companies of the future.

*Note: all of this is a work in progress. I am constantly learning and updating my understanding of what it means to build a startup here. I will be writing more about this over time and feel free to [email me](mailto:max@drifty.com) with thoughts or comments.*
