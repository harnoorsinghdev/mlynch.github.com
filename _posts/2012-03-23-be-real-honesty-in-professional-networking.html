    <p>When I was new to the entrepreneur and business networking scene, I was very formal when talking with people and explaining my business. I gave the standard pitch, ignored the obvious holes in my business plan, and sugar coated my responses. I felt I had something to prove.&nbsp;</p>
<div>Then we failed. Turned the servers off, notified mentors and friends, and moved out of the office. I took a good year ignoring the entrepreneurial and networking scenes.</div>
<p />
<div>When I came back, I realized the strongest and most beneficial relationships I had developed were with people I did not feel like I had something to prove to, and who did not appear to have anything to prove to me. &nbsp;Being able to share a really big or personal concern with an experienced mentor that you have developed an honest relationship with is a really great feeling.</div>
<p />
<div>I stopped caring so much about pretending like everything was happy when it wasn't. Running a company is hard, but every single business has potential potholes in the road. I'd rather have a successful company than for everyone to think I'm this big super business guy who has all the right answers, when I'm not. I want help navigating the issues that no one is immune to, and I want honest help that comes from experience rather than machismo.</div>
<p />
<div>I see it again with really new entrepreneurs (don't get me wrong, I'm still very new). They give you the canned pitch. They get hostile to honest questions, and they don't share their deep, dark concerns. It's hard to connect with someone in an honest way when they are acting.</div>
<p />
<div>Likewise, it's hard to take feedback from someone who seems to have the ultimate answer for what you should do with your business, after knowing you for only a few minutes.&nbsp;As in product development, "answers" are dangerous: we can only make guesses, experiment, learn, and make changes. Those willing to work with you through these steps are the most helpful and sincere.</div>
<p />
<div>The entrepreneurial community in your local area benefits from honesty and collaboration. Don't try to trick everyone, It's not doing your community or&nbsp;<em>your business</em> any favors.</div>
