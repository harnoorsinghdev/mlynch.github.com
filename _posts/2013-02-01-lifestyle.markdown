"Lifestyle business" is, frankly, a derogatory term used by fundraising zealots and the tech media to describe a business where the *assumed* aspirations of the founders are to simply provide a nice lifestyle for themselves, and that's it.

It's often used in comparison to "high-growth venture-backed" businesses that are out to "change the world" on their rocketship.

I find the term rather silly when you look at what Mojang [just pulled in](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5151227) for Minecraft (92 MM USD profit on 236 MM USD of revenue). If you use the definition of a lifestyle business as one that has not taken outside funding, then Mojang is a lifestyle business.

Take a look at Github and Mailchimp for two more examples that many would have called "lifestyle business" but are absolutely killing it and truly changing the way the world works.

Personally, I've had my company called a lifestyle business many times, because we have bootstrapped and might continue to do so. It always seems implied that we want to stay small and not really make a dent in the universe. In reality, we just have a way of working that feels right to us, and we think we can grow just fine without bringing on outside investment and still make a big impact.

Do us all a favor: stop using such shallow terms. There are some really awesome companies that don't fit the fundraising mold yet have had a huge impact on the world, and we should be celebrating them.

Of course, there is nothing wrong with fundraising, but the entrepreneurial pursuit is never black and white.
