    <p>I need to get out of the habit of trying to do everything from the python interactive shell. Even with ipython most of the time I find myself having to re-enter my code over and over until I get it right. It's very frustrating. <p /> Basically, if I need to do a loop, I find it faster to just write a small script than to try to get it right in the REPL.</p>
<p>Not to mention that ipython has a nasty bug that complains about improper indentation levels when recalling a block of code.&nbsp; The solution is to call %autocall 0.</p>
