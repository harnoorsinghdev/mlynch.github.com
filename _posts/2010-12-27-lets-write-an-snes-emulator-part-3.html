    I had a few thoughts on my SNES emulator project while enjoying some time in the northwoods of Wisconsin for Christmas. I've decided to just try to build an emulator that will execute some simple 65816 programs. I've started creating code for registers, memory locations, instructions, and programs (just a sequence of instructions). Each instruction will result in an "execution plan" describing which operand will act upon the register or memory arguments to aid in debugging. I've just started writing some of the shell and I hope to have a very basic 65816 emulator up on github this week along with my work so far. Once I've gotten a working 65816 emulator I will start looking at the ROMs and SNES specific stuff again to see where to go next.
