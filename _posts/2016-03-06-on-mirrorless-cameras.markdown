A few weeks ago I acquired my first mirrorless camera, a Fujifilm X-E2S with the Fujinon 35mm F2 R WR lens.

Previously, I used a lower-end Canon DSLR and my iPhone for most of my photography, so I was in need of an upgrade. I researched my options: bulky profesional DSLRs with tons of features I didn't need, and Leica's with a price tag I couldn't afford. By chance, I stumbled on the Fujifilm line, and was immediately smitten with the aesthetic: classic rangefinder-esque with modern conveniences. I knew I just *had* to have one.

After a few weeks of use, I have some initial reactions on the camera. First, the JPEG image quality is incredible with a "magic" that's hard to describe. The EVF and LCD have tons of premium features like leveling, focus peaking, face detection, and more. The camera feels solid yet light, film era meets modern day.

One of the wonderful secrets of the X series, and other mirrorless cameras like it, is how easily they support old film lenses. With a simple glass-free adapter, classic Minolta Rokkor, Canon, Pentax, Nikkor, and other lenses can be given new life in the digital age.

Yes, these lenses are going to be manual-only, but with modern features like Focus Peaking that highlight the in-focus area in the viewfinder, manual becomes much more practical. I bought a few old Rokkor lenses on ebay based on [Rokkor Files](http://www.rokkorfiles.com/Lenses.html) reviews (50mm f/1.4, 58mm f/1.4, 45mm f/2, 28mm f/2.8, and a 135mm f/2.8) for ~$240 with shipping. Five quality lenses for less than the price of one Fujinon 35mm.

You'll notice I bought three Rokkor lenses in the ~50mm focal length, which seems redundant. One of the fun parts about finding and researching old lenses is hearing about the history of each lens type. I found that, in many cases, one focal length line could be dramatically better in construction and performance than another depending on the volume produced, manufacturing process, and era of the lens. I tried a few in the ~50mm focal length based on those reviews, with the expectation that I'd use each one for different purposes. Plus, it's hard to say no to a $20 quality lens.
