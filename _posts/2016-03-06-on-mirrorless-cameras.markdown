A few weeks ago I acquired my first mirrorless camera, a Fujifilm X-E2S with the Fujinon 35mm F2 R WR lens.

Previously, I used a lower-end Canon DSLR and my iPhone for most of my photography, so I was in need of an upgrade. I researched my options: bulky profesional DSLRs with tons of features I didn't need, and Leica's with a price tag I couldn't afford. By chance, I stumbled on the Fujifilm line, and was immediately smitten with the aesthetic: classic rangefinder-esque with modern conveniences. I knew I just *had* to have one.

After a few weeks of use, I have some initial reactions on the camera. First, the JPEG image quality is incredible with a "magic" that's hard to describe. The EVF and LCD have tons of premium features like leveling, focus peaking, face detection, and more. The camera feels solid yet light, film era meets modern day.

One of the wonderful secrets of the X series, and other mirrorless cameras like it, is how easily they support old film lenses. With a simple glass-free adapter, classic Minolta Rokkor, Canon, Pentax, Nikkor, and other lenses can be given new life in the digital age.

Yes, these lenses are going to be manual-only, but with modern features like Focus Peaking that highlight the in-focus area in the viewfinder, manual becomes much more practical. I bought a few old Rokkor lenses on ebay based on [Rokkor Files](http://www.rokkorfiles.com/Lenses.html) reviews (50mm f/1.4, 58mm f/1.4, 45mm f/2, 28mm f/2.8, and a 135mm f/2.8) for ~$240 with shipping. Five quality lenses for less than the price of one Fujinon 35mm.

You'll notice I bought three lenses in the ~50mm focal length, which seems redundant. One of the fun parts about finding and researching old lenses is hearing about the history of each lens type. I found that, in many cases, one focal length line could be dramatically better in construction and performance than another depending on the volume produced, manufacturing process, and era of the lens. I tried a few in the ~50mm focal length based on those reviews, with the expectation that I'd use each one for different purposes. Plus, it's hard to say no to a $20 fast and quality lens in any focal length.

Back to the camera. On a Fujifilm aperture and shutter speed are configured through analog dials. The most common state is aperture priority where the shutter speed is automatically chosen by the camera and the aperture can be changed by the user. Most lenses have an aperture ring that you rotate through f-stops, or lock in "auto" mode to push the camera into shutter priority mode. The shutter speed is configured through a classic dial. Both features hark back to film days and force the user to get involved in the photo-making process.

The aperture dial is yet another reason old film lenses work so well on this camera. Unlike Canon lenses where so much of the lens is controlled by the body, Fujifilm X cameras expect aperture and manual focus to be lens-controlled. For example, my Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM lens has to be attached to a Canon (or compatible) body to control both the aperture *and* the focus, which makes it pretty much useless on any other camera. Since old film lenses are lens controlled, they work amazingly well on an X body.

I found the dial approach to be quick and painless once I got used to them again, and appreciate that the settings stay put better than fully digital approaches like most DSLRs. One major feature I find myself using all the time is the exposure compensation dial. Having this dial so accessible makes it simple to quickly over or under (more commmonly) expose a shot. On my canon that option was hidden through an awkward Q sub-menu.

Auto ISO modes with a pre-configured upper bounds and minimum shutter speed are a great way to quickly move between low and normal lighting situations without fiddling through options. I can let the camera jump to 6400 ISO if absolutely necessary but maintain a 1/60 shutter speed, for example. A more optimal shot could be taken, perhaps, but not without a pause to change options.

A few nice features I use constantly are the Wi-Fi and Film Simulation modes. With the Wi-Fi setting, photos can be quickly transferred to a smartphone without going through a slow SD-card import process. The Film Simulation modes simulate classic Fuji film, based on their years of creating film products, and do a great job adding sophistication to shots without looking like an over-the-top instagram filter.
