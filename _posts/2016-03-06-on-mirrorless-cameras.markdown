A few weeks ago I acquired my first mirrorless camera, a Fujifilm X-E2S. Historically, I used a Canon DSLR and my iPhone for most of my photography.

I was initially attracted to the Fujifilm X line of cameras by the aesthetic: classic rangefinder-esque with modern conveniences.
Plus, the photos my friends took with theirs had this *magic* that's hard to describe.
