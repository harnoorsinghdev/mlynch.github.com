Ever since I started [Drifty](http://drifty.com/) I've been intrigued by how startups work, and how the startup world says they should work. 

And I've been fortunate to have learned a lot about how they work. I've started a company with my best friend, hacked an MVP together and got an initial user base, bootstrapped the company, hired people, raised money, and focused hard on how to really grow it.

Most people know I'm a huge fan of bootstrapping. Staying independent, building the products *you* want to build, and focusing on what is best for the customers.

<!--
But by many measures, bootstrapping is considered folly in the startup world. You're not investing enough in growth, you aren't thinking
big enough, you're building a "lifestyle business," yadda yadda. Most of the negativity around bootstrapping is perpetuated by the VC community that doesn't really
gain anything from you keeping that cap table nice and simple.

But this isn't a rant about VCs. We have some [great ones](http://arthurventures.com/) who have been immensely helpful to us. Rather, I am fascinated by bootstrapping because it shows a tear in the fabric of startup culture mythos.

Some of the [best](http://basecamp.com/) [bootstrapped](http://atlassian.com/) [companies](http://mailchimp.com/) have defined all odds to create immense value through non-institutional capital means. Some of them raised money later, yes, but 
achieved far more than most startups do without raising a cent.

<!--
Bootstrapped companies are pretty well understood at this point. You basically focus on making money as soon as possible and you grow at a sustainable rate based on what your customer growth and core metrics can bear.

But at the core, bootstrapped companies are *self-sufficient*. They are often started by a team that could build the product they are going to sell (rather than outsourcing it or having to hire a team), and had a close-knit founding team.
-->

To me, bootstrapping represents a possible future of startups for many people, because capital costs have dropped sufficiently such that companies can create great value for little cost. Many founders will choose this route because it maximizes many things they care about (independence, control, ownership, etc.) while minimizing things they don't care about (growth at all costs, loss of control, focus on exits, etc.).

### The "Lab"

But this isn't about bootstrapping. Rather, I've been intrigued by a *new* kind of startup format that I will refer to now as a "lab."

Kevin Rose is pretty much the poster child for this new startup format. His two companies [Milk](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/milk) and now [North](http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/15/kevin-rose-google-ventures-north/) are essentially "startup labs": they are focusing on building new apps and social products to see what takes off. If something works, it's assumed the team will focus on that
or will spin off the product into a separate company with a new team to grow and scale the product.

While Kevin's team has only shipped [one failed app](http://mashable.com/2012/03/14/kevin-roses-oink-folds/), I'm sure they learned a ton about how to make the system work.

Another interesting example is the Samwer brothers' [Rocket Internet](https://www.rocket-internet.com/). Billed as the "world's largest incubator," they have found success cloning successful startups and tailoring them for a non-US userbase. While I don't like their approach, they've shown the model can be wildly successful.

One fascinating difference between a lab and a bootstrapped startup is while bootstrappers keep everything they make (including the responsibilities of the products they create), the "lab" does not, almost as a rule.

For many technical founders, the goal isn't to work on one thing forever. Rather, it's to create lots of new products and have a diversity of problem spaces they attack. These founders find scaling a business a lot less interesting than starting up new ones, but when they raise VC money they are left with the choice of focusing only on this one space for the next 5-10 years (and moving from product into executive management), or leaving and doing something else (and probably losing a good chunk of potential upside).

And even if they pick the long road of building and scaling a working business, with standard VC financing rounds and assuming the probable case that your startup isn't a [black swan or "unicorn"](http://paulgraham.com/swan.html), founder take-home might be the same whether you work 10 years, raise 5 rounds, and sell for $200M vs working a few years, raising little capital, and selling for $20M.

### Upside

A Lab has a different ownership structure and upside opportunities are a bit murkier. At first glance, the two sweet spots for Labs to make as much money as possible is to build a product quickly, see rapid adoption, and sell it to someone else or spin it out to a new team to scale it up (while retaining some equity ownership over it).

In the case of a spin-out, perhaps this new team can raise VC and scale the product, with the lab taking some liquidity.

The problem is that both acquirers and investors usually want the team often more than the product. Labs are going to have to figure out how to retain the independence of the product team while enabling the sale or growth of the products they create.

### A new future

In the face of so few startup choices, the Lab represents something new. It's the joy of creating new products, the lack of responsibility VC-scale requires, the self-sufficiency of bootstrapping, the ability to keep great teams together, but the ability to grow and scale and retain upside on things that work.

I think there is a crucial caveat to the Lab model: you *have* to have an incredible product team. A developer/designer duo perhaps, or a team that has worked together before and wants to stick together. I don't think it will work with a ragtag team though those often work in the VC startup land.

This is probably why we see so few Lab startups. It turns out that combo is pretty rare. I have a hunch it can be engineered but we will have to wait and see.

For now I'm eagerly watching this new model evolve, because it represents something exciting to me: the ability to rapidly change the world in as many problem spaces as possible, while still being able to find financial success. 

Teams that pull this off will find themselves working on more interesting problems, for less investment in time, and with potentially greater upside for the individuals creating the first versions of the product.
