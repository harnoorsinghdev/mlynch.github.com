Ever since I started [Drifty](http://drifty.com/) I've been intrigued by how startups work, and how the startup world says they should work. 

And I've been fortunate to have learned a lot about how they work. I've started a company with my best friend, hacked an MVP together and got an initial user base, bootstrapped the company, hired people, raised money, and focused hard on how to really grow it.

Most people know I'm a huge fan of bootstrapping. Staying independent, building the products *you* want to build, and focusing on what is best for the customers.

<!--
But by many measures, bootstrapping is considered folly in the startup world. You're not investing enough in growth, you aren't thinking
big enough, you're building a "lifestyle business," yadda yadda. Most of the negativity around bootstrapping is perpetuated by the VC community that doesn't really
gain anything from you keeping that cap table nice and simple.

But this isn't a rant about VCs. We have some [great ones](http://arthurventures.com/) who have been immensely helpful to us. Rather, I am fascinated by bootstrapping because it shows a tear in the fabric of startup culture mythos.

Some of the [best](http://basecamp.com/) [bootstrapped](http://atlassian.com/) [companies](http://mailchimp.com/) have defined all odds to create immense value through non-institutional capital means. Some of them raised money later, yes, but 
achieved far more than most startups do without raising a cent.

<!--
Bootstrapped companies are pretty well understood at this point. You basically focus on making money as soon as possible and you grow at a sustainable rate based on what your customer growth and core metrics can bear.

But at the core, bootstrapped companies are *self-sufficient*. They are often started by a team that could build the product they are going to sell (rather than outsourcing it or having to hire a team), and had a close-knit founding team.
-->

To me, bootstrapping represents a possible future of startups for many people, because capital costs have dropped sufficiently such that companies can create great value for little cost. Many founders will choose this route because it maximizes many things they care about (independence, control, ownership, etc.) while minimizing things they don't care about (growth at all costs, loss of control, focus on exits, etc.).

### The "Lab"

But this isn't about bootstrapping. Rather, I've been intrigued by a *new* kind of startup format that I will refer to now as a "lab."

Kevin Rose is pretty much the poster child for this new startup format. His two companies [Milk](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/milk) and now [North](http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/15/kevin-rose-google-ventures-north/) are essentially "startup labs": they are focusing on building new apps and social products to see what takes off. If something works, it's assumed the team will focus on that
or will spin off the product into a separate company with a new team to grow and scale the product.

While Kevin's team has only shipped [one failed app](http://mashable.com/2012/03/14/kevin-roses-oink-folds/), I'm sure they learned a ton about how to make the system work.

One fascinating difference between a lab and a bootstrapped startup is while bootstrappers keep everything they make (including the responsibilities of the products they create), the "lab" does not, almost as a rule.

For many technical founders, the goal isn't to work on one thing forever. Rather, it's to create lots of new products and have a diversity of problem spaces they attack. Many technical founders find scaling a business a lot less interesting than startup new ones, but when they raise VC company they are left with the choice of focusing only on this one space for the next 5-10 years, or leave and do something else (and possibly loosing any chance at upside).

And even then, with standard VC financing rounds and assuming the probable case that your startup isn't a [black swan or "unicorn"](http://paulgraham.com/swan.html), founder take-home might be the same whether you work 10 years, raise 5 rounds, and sell for $200M vs working a few years, raising little capital, and selling for $20M.
