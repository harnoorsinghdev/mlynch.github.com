    I&#039;ve been neglecting my SNES emulator project lately.  I&#039;ve been hard at work at <a href="http://perblue.com" class="moz-txt-link-freetext">http://perblue.com</a> and on my side-project <a href="http://widgetfame.com">Widgetfame</a>.  However, I spent a little bit of time on it tonight.  Basically, I&#039;m digging into the 6502 instruction set (which is a subset of the 65816 instruction set and an easier place to start) and starting to write basic 6502 instructions.  I&#039;ve started on the basic execution loop and started some instruction decoding stuff.  More to come in the next few weeks.
