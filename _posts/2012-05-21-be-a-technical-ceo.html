    <div>I started my current startup <a href="http://codiqa.com/">Codiqa</a> with one of my best friends&nbsp;<a href="http://bensperry.com/">Ben Sperry</a>&nbsp;one weekend when we were just randomly talking about cool new ideas. Ben and I had worked on several side websites just for fun, exploring some interesting ideas and just honing our product development chops. However, we never really wanted to turn any of them into real businesses.</div><p /><div>As soon as we started exploring the idea of mobile web and native development with HTML5 and jQuery Mobile, we knew the idea felt different. It seemed like there was a real need based on our personal experiences, and that we were the right team to try to fill that need.&nbsp;</div><p /><div>This was the summer of 2011. In late 2010 I had shut down the startup I co-founded and built during college, and I was kind of burned out from all the business bullshit. I really wasn't interested in getting back into the pitches and networking and fakeness of it all, but I really loved making polished software products that people could use and find valuable. I had&nbsp;gained a negative opinion of the "CEO" role, and I didn't feel like I was cut out for it considering my disdain for the social side of running a company.</div><p /><div>For the rest of summer 2011 Ben and I worked on Codiqa in our spare time. We were having fun and Codiqa was a big technical challenge for me, so I was learning and broadening my development skill set. We still weren't sure we wanted to turn it into a business. I wasn't even talking about it or pitching it to anyone, I just didn't feel like I had to prove the idea. I didn't give a shit if it was viable or not.</div><p /><div>Then we put up a beta website and signup form, and a fair number of people signed up. It was a really exciting time for us and we felt ourselves getting pushed into taking Codiqa more seriously. We hunkered down and just focused on adding the last few features, fixing bugs from early users, and getting a real website up. We launched a month later to a really great reception and decided that we could really make a real business out of Codiqa.</div><p /><div>Since then, we've been slowly growing our user base and revenues. We are almost ramen profitable, and we are having a blast. Ben and I work really well together and we each have roles we've fallen into.&nbsp;I am both the CEO and CTO of Codiqa. I handle all of the software development, and most of the business development related stuff (partnerships, licensing, acquisitions, investments, etc). Ben is the customer champion and design/UX side. He handles all customer emails and support tickets, and refines the look and experience of our products.</div><p /><div>Ben and I interviewed at Y Combinator a few months ago. It was actually my second time preparing, and this time just felt so different. Unlike with my last company, I could talk about Codiqa organically for hours. I didn't have to rehearse my lines (seriously, I had to do that with my last company), and I was way more confident about my idea.</div><p /><div>But at the end of the day, I'm just a techie who loves making things and I happen to be running a company that is starting to see real growth. I don't have an MBA, I've never written a business plan, and I prefer coding over doing business development and networking.</div><p /><div>I realized most of the business stuff I could do myself, but instead of trying to become a master of all things CEO (like raising money or financial projections), I have tried to build a network of mentors that can help me when I'm over my head (which is often).</div><p /><div>So if you are a developer or designer interested in building something but you don't feel like you are cut out for running a business, just fucking build the damn thing. If it comes from the heart and you love what you do, the business side will just come naturally. Yes, you will be out of your element most of the time, but that's fun and you'll see yourself grow each day. As an added benefit you will feel more ownership over the product and I bet that will translate to a better product developed with more agility and less cash.</div><p /><div>I want to help do away with the myth that you need a business guy to get your technical startup off the ground. You don't. You are capable of doing it on your own. In fact, you might be better off doing it on your own. Software is a huge part of running a startup and having to balance development with the business side helps you make difficult decisions to prioritize your work.</div><p /><div>Jump in! It's a blast.</div>
