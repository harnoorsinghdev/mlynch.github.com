I absolutely love building products for the web. It's such a rush to create something new the world has never seen that is both polished and useful. It's also nice when you can make some money from your products, too.

When starting a new product, here are the steps I take:

__1. Find something people want__

"What is something people really want? Is there a pain point somewhere that I can solve? Do *I* have any pain points that could be solved? Am I passionate about this space?"

Twitter search is one of the best ways to research this quickly. You can validate an idea through tweeting faster than anything else.

If you aren't passionate about this, don't do it. The best work comes from authentic passion.

__2. Find something people will pay for__

"Would *I* pay for this solution to the problem. If not, does there exist a type of person who would?"

I think it's okay if the pain point addressed isn't exactly yours, as long as you feel confident you understand the domain and can really solve someone's problem in a way that is valuable to them.

__3. Find a business model__

"Is there a business model here with a clear value exchange that I can build a sustainable business on?"

I am only interested in business models that offer a product for a price, either recurring or large one-time purchases. I am not interested in creating social product businesses since the failure rates are astronomical and I don't find the business models interesting.

When in doubt, I start with a monthly recurring charge since it's mutually beneficial: you get somewhat consistent revenue and customers get a product that can sustain itself and won't disappear like Sparrow.

__4. Pick a name, find a domain__

I've had all kinds of names in the past. As long as people can spell it and I like the way it looks and sounds, I'm fine with it. 

I find open domains on [Instant Domain Search](http://instantdomainsearch.com/) since they won't steal your domain if you leave the shopping cart. I buy the domains on Namecheap.

__5. Use heroku for hosting__

I used to use Linode or a VPS provider. I've since changed because Heroku will save you tons of time down the road. I've wasted hours setting up database backups, worrying about disk space usage, configuring web servers, etc. It's just not worth it. Use Heroku.

Heroku gives you the most bang for your time, take advantage of it.

__6. Build a landing page, promote it__

This is one of your first user tests. Build a simple landing page that pitches the product and the vision. Use "alpha/beta" liberally because people understand what it means and they won't expect perfection.

Gather emails and send them to Mailchimp. I now use double-opt-in on my forms because they increase the quality of your mailing lists as the product grows.

Make sure you offer a way to tweet about the page after signing up. This is your first chance to build some virality.

__7. Build a Proof-of-Concept__

What constitutes a proof of concept will vary between each person and product. The key point is that you should get something out that demonstrates the idea in a workable way so customers can get on board with your vision.

For my main product [Codiqa](http://codiqa.com/), our POC was delayed since the software was a bit complicated to build.

Perfection is *bad* here. Design details don't really matter at this point, so don't waste time getting it pixel-perfect.

__8. Share and Listen__

This is the part where you gather information and wait. Invite users from your mailing list and gather feedback with an embedded Google form.

Listen for customers taking your rough sketch and filling in the missing parts, this means you are creating something they understand and find interesting. This is the making of user passion.

__9. Engage with users__

Email users often, more than you feel comfortable doing. The great [Patrick McKenzie](http://www.kalzumeus.com/) says you should send more email than you are. Listen to and email him, he's really smart and helpful.

__10. Iterate__

Now you know whether what you've made hit the mark or missed. Don't accept a lukewarm response as a signal to continue development. This means you aren't really inspiring anyone and they probably won't pay for your product.

Pick one small feature, implement it, and ship it. Work towards your MVP and charging as your first priority at this stage.

__11. Be careful with freemium__

Freemium is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it helps lots of people get into your product, which increases your potential paying customer base later, but it can also devalue any premium plans you create.

I removed freemium from Codiqa recently and we've since made more money. I'm no longer interested in freemium but I think n-day trials are still useful.

__12. Charge__

You've got a product people find valuable. Now it's time for the classic value exchange: ask for money (I use [Stripe](http://stripe.com/)) and put it in your bank account.

Keep your pricing plans super simple to start. I'm starting to like the one monthly price or the one yearly price (express the yearly price as a monthly discount).

__13. Market that shit!__

Marketing is not my strong point, and I used to think as a programmer I'd always be bad at it, especially since I'm not an extrovert.

It's actually easier than it sounds: share your passion for your product with others and spread the word. The most passionate marketers are far more effective than the most extroverted, smooth talkers. 

Don't be a "salesperson", no one will believe you.

__14. Enjoy it__

You've created something that has put a small dimple in the world. Be proud of it and have a beer to celebrate!
