Most often when we talk about career risk it's in a relatively short time context. If I leave my job tomorrow, I won't be able to afford rent next month. If I just stay and work a few more 60 hour weeks, a promotion or raise is right around the corner.

For our jobs, risk is all about balancing an unknown future with a certain present. Our friends, social life, and title at our jobs are all obvious and manageable. Our future job role, salary, and influence are not.

Since we work best with a known set of data, we tend to make decisions to maximize our short-term stability. Instead of leaving everything we know for an uncertain future, we tend to stay put and *wait*.

This waiting game is seen as less risky than not waiting. When in reality, it's actually *far* riskier.

Perhaps my favorite exploration of career risk is [The Startup Spouse: On Risks, Trade-Offs And Never Sleeping On The Floor](http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/86543/The-Startup-Spouse-On-Risks-Trade-Offs-And-Never-Sleeping-On-The-Floor.aspx). In this wonderful post, the husband of the author leaves his job to start a startup, which is deemed almost certainly risky by her social circle. They all wonder what got in to him, and why he's "jeopardizing [their] financial security."

When asked "Why are we starting a company now?" the husband responds

> Risk is about evaluating trade-offs, and evaluating trade-offs requires the consideration of opportunity costs: if I do this, then I can't do that. I could stay at my finance job, continue earning a salary, and insulate myself against the risk of [my company's] failure. But what about the opportunity cost of my time?
> Although it seems counterintuitive at first, staying at my day job offers very limited upside financially and professionally. __I think that's actually the riskier path__.

I have experienced this first hand. The few times I've left my job were very difficult decisions. Why am I doing this? I'm getting paid well, isn't it enough? Why would I throw this all away to start over somewhere else? What will my girlfriend think? What will future employers think about my job history?

In the end, each time I have been better off. I've dramatically improved my earning potential, learned a ton of new things, worked with really experienced people, and expanded my professional network many times over. I can safely say my value increased each time much more than if I had stayed at my job.

In fact, staying at my job each time has been much riskier than leaving, I just couldn't see what the future held.

Final Thoughts
-----------

Here are some thoughts that helped me finally make the leap. For each of these, if the answer lies beyond your current job, seriously consider the opportunity cost to ignore the problem.

 1. Picture yourself in your dream "job" (this could be self-employment). Is it what you're doing now?

 2. What if you moved all the way up in this job, would you feel satisfied?

 3. Will employers really care if you left your job, as long as it's not a pattern of consistent quitting? Would you even want to work for them if they did?

 4. Are you significantly underpaid compared to average earners in your field? Do you feel taken advantage of? Are you respected by your employers?

 5. Do you feel like you could be learning more? Do you want a bigger challenge?

__What about you? Have you left a job and wish you did it sooner? Or did you regret it? How did you reconcile your choice given the other options?__
