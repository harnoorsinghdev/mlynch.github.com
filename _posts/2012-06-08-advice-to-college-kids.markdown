<p class="meta">13 June 2012 - Madison</p>

A week ago I spoke on a panel at the [Wisconsin Entrepreneurs Conference](http://www.wisconsintechnologycouncil.com/events/ent_conf/). The panel was made up of Forrest Woolworth of [PerBlue](http://perblue.com/) and Matt Howard of [U Connect](http://www.uconnectllc.com/). The topic of the panel was college startups, our experiences running them, and our advice to other college kids interested in starting companies while in college.  I think it's an interesting topic and I have much more to say than I was able to due to time constraints. This blog is directed at people interested in joining or starting startups, that have the desire to take the road less traveled and make themselves independently prolific.

Dream big, start small
----------------------

I know it's easy to get caught up with delusions of grandeur. Don't let them distract you from making small accomplishments each day. All the companies you look up to took a long time to get where they are. If you don't focus and connect the dots of your dreams, you won't be able to get there.

Drop out, or not
----------------

I graduated in four years from UW-Madison. I didn't drop out, so I'm not an authority on this. But, maybe *you* should. Why not apply to [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/) or [TechStars](http://techstars.com/) right now? In my opinion, being confident and independent enough to not do what everyone else is doing (i.e. staying in school) will only separate you from your peers in the future. In a world where there are too many graduates and not enough jobs, why don't you do something that far fewer people are doing, like starting a company? It sure seems like a better idea than taking on tons of debt.

If you don't want to drop out, think hard about your priorities. When you graduate, what will employers care more about, grades or creative projects? What about the employer that _you want to work for_? Don't worry about impressing employers who care about shit that doesn't matter, you would hate working there anyways.

Oh, and if you're like me and you want to be self-employed for the rest of your life, then what do _you_ care more about?

Don't wear a suit
-----------------

Assuming you don't live in one of the tech hubs of the US, when you venture out and join the local business community you will feel really young and out of place. You will feel obligated to dress up and be "professional."  Don't do it if you don't feel like it's "you": these meaningless standards are dying out.

Put your earmuffs on
--------------------

If you are new to starting a company you will feel the need to do lots of networking, attend events, and other things that aren't directly related to your business. It's common advice from young entrepreneurs that much of this is wasted time, and when you dig into it you'll be better at predicting what's a waste of time and what's worth doing. There is so much bullshitting going on that you just have to be confident that you'll be better off for tuning it out. I've blogged about [bullshit networking](http://maxlynch.com/blog/be-real-honesty-in-professional-networking/) before, but the basic idea is that if you are finding it really hard to form honest relationships with certain people in the business community, stop wasting your time trying to. I really cherish the stronger connections I've made, but it takes a long time and they were not formed through sales pitches.

Say "no" to business plans
--------------------------

You can win lots of money and services by doing business plan contests. But, you are wasting precious time that could have been spent *actually building something*. At the end of the day what does a company need to survive, customers or business plan contest trophies?

Business plans are complete bullshit, too. You end up tweaking the numbers so they look nice and perfect. You are just guessing and pretending. You'll be in for a rude awakening when you put your product into the wild and it breaks all your rules.

There are some cool contests starting up like the [CS NEST](https://contest.cs.wisc.edu/) contest that ask you to make something real. I won $5k from one of these contests, *and* I had something to show for it. Do these instead or don't do any at all.

Do it now
---------

College is the best time to start a company, period. Maybe you even live with a potential co-founder and you don't even realize it. [Ben](http://bensperry.com/) and I lived together for three years and only started working on startups when we graduated and moved out! I cringe thinking about all the time we could have been coding but instead played beer pong (on second thought, I wouldn't trade that for the world).

Think lean
----------

My college startup had a pretty big enterprise sales component. In fact we spent half a year trying to close a contract with a Fortune 50 company. I think a more realistic and healthy approach would have been to make our product into a web app that ran itself with far less sales work required.

Charge for it
-------------

In college I didn't believe I could make money by selling a product. If you've never had someone pay you for something you've made, it's really hard to see how someone would. Once it happens though it's really empowering. Make something, be confident, and put a price tag on It.

Patience
--------

I've also blogged about how [patience is my worst enemy](http://maxlynch.com/blog/patience/). Young people, especially entrepreneurs, like to see results, and *fast*. When you leave college you'll realize that life slows down a bit. You fall into a routine and the seasons change faster than ever before.

I think this is a good thing. If you are getting stuff done each day, having this routine and staying patient will help you evolve each year. It's 6 months since we had Codiqa in our first users' hands, and we are always delighted to see how far we've come from those patient roots. 

Also, resist the urge to work more than 10 hours a day. You will burn out and be frustrated when the rest of the world can't keep up with you.

Be real
-------

The world is desperately waiting for __you__. Be yourself and make your own mark on the world. It's nonconformity which changes the world.
