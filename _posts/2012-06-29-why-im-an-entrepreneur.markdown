I've been thinking a lot about what drives me to be an entrepreneur. It's a certain brand of craziness that rejects well paying, stable jobs for something that guarantees absolutely nothing financially.

The best reason I can come up with is that creating a product and getting people to pay for it is one of the most challenging yet fulfilling things humans can do, and I can't help myself but do it.

When you get your first customer and you disprove the [myth of making money with a product](http://joel.is/post/25021580513/making-money-with-a-product-a-myth), it's one of the most empowering and special feelings in the world. As Jason Fried puts it, "after sex, relationships, and family, the most intimate relationship between two people is when someone gives you a dollar bill for what you do for a living." It's a truly special thing to convince someone to pay you for something you've made, and you don't soon forget the feeling.

But running a company is a far cry from perfect happiness. There are days I just feel terrible, like everything could crumble to pieces in the blink of an eye. Those days I dread reading my morning emails, fearing for a disastrous bug report, or a cancelled paying user, or even a declined customer credit card. Those things always seem to have a way of clustering together during bad times, making them worse.

But the highs are so fucking high that it makes it all worth it. The big paying account, the customer that *loves* your product, and the connections you make with the outside world. The personal growth, seeing yourself overcome challenges you used to be too afraid to face. There is truly nothing like it.

In fact, running a company makes you feel so *alive* that I couldn't imagine going back to being a 9-5 programmer, making something for someone else's gain. I want the job with the most responsibility, personal challenge, and diversity of work. 

That job is being an entrepreneur, and that job is great.
