Some habits that hurt my productivity that I need to work out:

* Checking email every 5 minutes
* Checking TweetDeck on about 10 columns every 5 minutes
* Checking Stripe every 5 minutes for how payments for our business are doing
* Writing every little blog post idea that comes to mind as soon as I think of it.

Back to work.
