    <p>One of my least favorite programming pursuits is dealing with date formatting. Specifically figuring out the right format string to parse a given date. I think it's a complete waste of time, but I understand some environments have need to be very strict. I would say most people can take the risk of an incorrectly parsed date and just use a good date parser.</p>
<p>The best library I've ever used for parsing dates is <a href="http://labix.org/python-dateutil">python-dateutil</a> for Python.&nbsp; I hear <a href="http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/userguide.html#Input_and_Output">Joda Time</a> for Java is good but it seems to suffer from the "having to know your date format before you parse" problem.&nbsp; Date parsing is hard, but python-dateutil does a great job for what I need it to so I can get on with my application.</p>
