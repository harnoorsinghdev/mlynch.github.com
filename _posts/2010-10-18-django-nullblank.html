    After all this time, I still don't understand why setting a model field to null=True isn't enough, and why sometimes you have to add blank=True. I understand the difference insofar as it has gotten in my way (blank requires data to be input on the admin page, null allows for SQL NULL values on the column). However, I feel like if I allow nulls, I shouldn't have to enter data on the admin page. <p /> Maybe I'm missing something, but I've never experienced blank being used apart from the admin page.
