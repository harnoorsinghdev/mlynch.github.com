"Lifestyle business" is, frankly, a derogatory term used by fundraising zealots to describe a business where the *assumed* aspirations of the founders are to simply provide a nice lifestyle for themselves, and that's it.

It's often used in comparison to "high-growth venture backed" businesses.

I find the term rather silly when you look at what Mojang [just pulled in](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5151227) for Minecraft (supposedly on 236 MM USD of revenue). If you use the definition of a lifestyle business as one that has not taken outside funding, then Mojang is a lifestyle business.

Take a look at Github and Mailchimp for two more examples that many would have called "lifestyle business" but are absolutely killing it.

Do us all a favor: stop using such shallow terms. The depth of entrepreneurship in the modern age deserves better.
