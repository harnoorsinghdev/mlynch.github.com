In 2012 and this first month of 2013, I achieved many dreams I had for myself and [my company](http://drifty.co/).

Perhaps biggest was my dream to create my own company that made enough money to pay myself and a few other people. We achieved that in October of 2012, less than a year after launching the company in January 2012.

Since then, we've hit milestones that I fantasized about but didn't think were possible.  

The thing is, every time we hit a milestone, it goes over without much fanfare. My standards are already raised by the time we hit them, and it just feels "boring" by then.

I've never been as happy or had as much fun achieving something as I had trying to get to the goal.

I doubt any of my future achievements will ever make me feel as happy as I do now, deep in the moment, deep in the grind. 

Maybe life isn't about the end, but enjoying the ride with people you love. Don't throw that away.

Good night.
