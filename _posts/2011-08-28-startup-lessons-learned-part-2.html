    <p>I spoke on the "Lesson's Learned" panel for the <a href="http://ftf2011.com/">Forward Technology Festival</a>&nbsp;last Friday in Madison. &nbsp;It was a really awesome experience and I learned a ton from the preparation, the other panelists, and people I spoke to at the event.</p>
<p />
<div>Here are my top lessons learned:</div>
<p />
<div><strong>1 - Go big</strong></div>
<p />
<div>If you believe in your product, you have to take the necessary steps to build momentum at each stage. &nbsp;Growing can be costly, and many business can be greatly helped by taking investment money. &nbsp;Don't let the fear of responsibility and "jumping right in" keep you from taking this next step if you have an opportunity. &nbsp;You've worked so hard to get to this point and you believe so much in your product, you're not going to just blow the investment money.</div>
<p />
<div>If you don't want to take investment money, think hard about what you can afford to spend money on, and how lack of capital can choke your business. Sometimes you have to spend money to make money.</div>
<p />
<div>Besides funding, it's important to believe in yourself and your ability to make sound decisions. There will be many pot holes along the way. Don't let them stop you.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>2 - Understand scale</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Think about what it would take to build a team of 10 (including yourself) and to provide them a competitive salary, benefits, and other perks. &nbsp;Suddenly the random $10, $20 signup doesn't look so good. &nbsp;If you are chasing large contracts, think about the static nature of the income. &nbsp;A "large" $20,000 contract signals customer interest but isn't even a quarter of one great programmer's salary.</div>
<p />
<div>Let's say you are spending $100k on each employee, times 10, with $50k in other annual expenses. &nbsp;You would be spending at least $1,050,000 a year (more money than most ever imagine). Just to break even you would need to make at least $87,500 a month, and would require at least 4375 $20 recurring subscriptions.</div>
<p />
<div>Fortunately, it's very possible to get to that stage. Think about <em>how many people</em>&nbsp;there are in the world, in your country, and in your market. &nbsp;If that number is tiny...well you've picked a difficult market.</div>
<p />
<div>It's kind of like selling a couch on craigslist. &nbsp;"Who'd want this shitty thing anyways?" you think, yet you get 20 emails in the course of a day. &nbsp;20 random people you've never met, who you didn't even know existed, want to buy something from you. And then when you meet up they happily hand you their $20 as if it was nothing. Imagine selling zero-cost copies of that couch each day, optimizing the process, and posting on different Craigslists all over the nation!. &nbsp;That's the power of scale in a digital goods and services business. As a plus: subscriptions build momentum as long as they are increasing over time. It's as if the same person bought the same couch from you every month indefinitely.</div>
<p />
<div>Unfortunately, you can't scale if you are the only one telling your story. &nbsp;Make your customers want to share your story, and enable them to do it easily. This is virality and it can be measured and constantly improved.</div>
<p />
<div>Think big because the world is a big place. &nbsp;Trust that humans have a terrible sense of scale and don't <em>believe</em>&nbsp;anything until it has been proven with data.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>3 - Measure</strong></div>
<p />
<div>I'm a skeptic. &nbsp;I don't really believe in anything unless it can be proven to be true.</div>
<p />
<div>Knowing that, why the hell did I <em>believe</em>&nbsp;so damn much when running my last startup? I believed some crazy things, such as believing that no one was using a version of GoBuzz that we ended up pivoting after to build yet another MVP. &nbsp;I believed I ruined a product when a customer ranted that I ruined something he liked (His words were "Booooo!"), and that he was never going to use the product again. &nbsp;I shouldn't have believed him, as he was active for months after that (even more so!)</div>
<p />
<div>I didn't know how much revenue we had, how many users we had, what parts of our application people were using, what they were doing on the app, or whether they were finding the app useful.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>I didn't measure. &nbsp;And because I didn't measure, I couldn't make small gains in the stats. &nbsp;I couldn't take 10 signups today and make it 12 tomorrow, because I didn't know anything about the product's daily life.</div>
<p />
<div>The most important metrics are conversion and retention. &nbsp;Conversion is the amount of users who enter your app, and perform a desired action (such as signing up, click past a landing page, etc). &nbsp;Conversion can be measured at every step in a process, and the drop offs (users who don't continue) will indicate valuable places to focus your optimization efforts. &nbsp;Retention is the amount of users who return to the app after using it. &nbsp;Generally, you can only measure retention when you have customer identity such as an active login, so this makes more sense after they have been converted.</div>
<p />
<div>Conversion and retention can be segmented and can help you define patterns that correlate with other metrics (such as returning for 3 or more days).</div>
<p />
<div><strong>4 - Listen to yourself</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Everyone has advice and suggestions for how you should run your business. &nbsp;Sometimes they can be helpful. &nbsp;Other times they can be distracting or even dangerous if you decide to act on them.</div>
<p />
<div>The Lean Startup method teaches customer development. &nbsp;Build something, measure it, and learn from it as you go back to the build phase. &nbsp;You can learn through data and also talking to customers.</div>
<p />
<div>This is great, but where GoBuzz failed in taking this to heart was a lack of data gathering. &nbsp;Without data, your only source of information are customer stories and advice from the startup community. &nbsp;Feedback can be helpful but it can also be spontaneous: you've asked a customer for their feedback and they have to give you something whether or not they were ever thinking it in the first place.</div>
<p />
<div>Likewise, advice from the startup community can be immensely helpful, but it can also be taken too much to heart. This community wants to help you succeed, so they give you ideas on how you can do that. &nbsp;Unfortunately, many don't intimately know your business and they haven't done the research on the market and haven't spent time on the product already.</div>
<p />
<div>Take the advice and suggestions but understand that sometimes you have to ignore them. &nbsp;Be the deciding voice, and take the path you think is best given your dreams and the data you have about your product. &nbsp;Instead of getting pulled side-to-side, find a rigid ladder, focus your energy, and climb up to the next platform. &nbsp;When you get to the next platform, you can move side-to-side to find another later, but the process must be repeated.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>If you try a million things and never get off the ground, perhaps you aren't listening to #1: yourself and your&nbsp;advisers.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>5 - Work smart</strong></div>
<p />
<div>If you are putting in 16+ hour days in the office, you are not working intelligently. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Think about how you feel and act each day of your life. Perhaps you are impatient, and like to make decisions as soon as you start thinking about them. Maybe you worry and find each negative data point extremely crushing.</div>
<p />
<div>When you pack too much work into a single day, you tend to make more decisions per unit of your "day to day perception." If you are feeling really impatient today, your decisions will reflect that. &nbsp;If you are despairing about the business, they will reflect that too. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Sleep on it. Spread out the decisions so that they can benefit from the multifaceted nature of your personality.</div>
<p />
<div>Also, make your product work <em>for</em>&nbsp;<em>you</em>. &nbsp;Your product can and should be selling itself every second of the day. &nbsp;Work towards automation if possible so you can build up the scale of your systems.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Conclusion</strong></div>
<p />
<div>I value highly having failed at building a business. &nbsp;As someone who learns best though experience, failing was almost like taking a class on building a startup. &nbsp;One that I actually attended and didn't just play Sudoku throughout.</div>
<p />
<div>If you are a new founder, I want to encourage you to make big strides in the direction you dream of going. &nbsp;It's easy to spin in circles if you aren't experienced making big decisions. Trust yourself and just go for it.</div>
