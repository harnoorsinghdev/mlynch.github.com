A few years ago I put two new activites on my bucket list: solo camping, and bike camping.

I first got enamored with solo camping while backpacking in the Porcupine Mountains in Michigan's Upper Peninsula with some friends. We ran into a woman solo backpacking for an extended weekend. As a scout leader and mother of children back home, she had a tradition of driving hours north from southern Wisconsin every year to fend for herself in Michigan's largest state park. I remember being incredibly impressed and inspired by her. Who does that? It was bad-ass.

The more I thought about solo camping, the more I was intrigued by the idea. I enjoy camping, especially backpacking, though I always did it in groups and with family and friends. Camping can be a lot work and being out *in it* can be stressful enough as a group, but doing it alone with no help or support at all? Crazy. I had to do it.

Addionally, I recently bought a new bike for the longer commute my recent move added
