A few weeks ago I threw up my hands and realized I'm thoroughly sick of the startup bullshit.

I'm sick of the buzz words. I'm sick of the entrepredouches. I'm sick of the pitch contests that encourage founders to spam their network for votes. I'm sick of the fundraising obsession.

I'm sick of talking about anything not related to making great products for your customers and growing your business.

The reality is growing a business is hard, but it's also incredibly fun and exciting to a lot of people. There seems to be an increasing number of startups forming these days from this pool. Unfortunately, the reality is most of these startups never get past the initial incubation stage of an idea.

This means we have a disproportionately large community of would-be entrepreneurs that have not done it, yet they make most of the noise.

There is nothing wrong with being excited about startups and talking about them all the time. The problem is if you can't see through it you become a victim to it.

You start to think being popular in this community means more than building a business. I know I made the same mistake, trying too hard to get fellow entrepreneurs to like me despite the fact that they had not really been successful.

I didn't know what success even meant in business, so I figured being loud and overconfident were good indicators of someone I should know.

It turns out that successful founders go to meetup events for entrepreneurs less than would-be entrepreneurs.
