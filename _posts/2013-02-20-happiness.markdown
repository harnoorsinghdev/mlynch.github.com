The last two years since I graduated college from UW-Madison have been a pure exercise in happiness.

When you're young and in school, it seems like the world is yours for the taking.

Unfortunately, the real world doesn't really live up to that expectation. Maybe you went on to get a Masters or Ph.D and ended up worse off. Or maybe you're stuck in a dead-end job that you hate in a city you feel you can't escape.

The hardest thing is dealing with the fact that your friends are all going to transition in different ways. Some better than others. It's tempting to feel shitty about not handling it as well as they have.
