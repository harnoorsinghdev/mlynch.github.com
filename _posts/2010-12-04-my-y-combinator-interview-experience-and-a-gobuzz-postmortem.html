    <p>My partner <a href="http://danvoell.com/">Dan Voell</a> and I, the co-founders of <a href="http://gobuzz.com">GoBuzz</a>, were selected to interview for the Winter 2011 funding round at Y Combinator in Mountain View.&nbsp; Unfortunately we were not selected, but it was such an awesome experience I wanted to share it with others to shed some light on the process.<p />  We had applied for the summer round and were not even asked for an interview, so when I applied for the winter round I wasn't really all that hopeful.&nbsp; In fact, I completely forgot about it until the day they were going to announce those selected for interviews.&nbsp; I found it comical how many people were freaking out on Hacker News when I didn't even remember it was happening.&nbsp; I had been too busy working on my company.<p />  GoBuzz had already been in business for about a year and a half, with five months full time work.&nbsp; While the basic idea of providing news about one's contacts as it happened stayed the same, our idea had morphed quite a bit over the year and a half.&nbsp; We initially developed an Outlook plugin, then went all web, then went all email, then went to a mixture of web and email (Alerts for your contacts were delivered through email and the web interface could be used to manage your contacts), all while trying to land on a solution that required the least amount of effort from the user and still provided value.<p />  As we had already been in business, we weren't sure how we would fit into the program.&nbsp; I was worried I would get to YC and do nothing but code for three months, with Dan being sidelined as a business guy; I wanted the three months to focus on growing our business rather than just our code base.&nbsp; To help us understand the experience we contacted as many YC Alumni or previous interviewees as we could to get their opinions.&nbsp; <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/brandonarbini">Brandon Arbini</a> from <a href="http://zencoder.com/">Zencoder</a> was a big help in this department as he helped dig up some documents on the legalities of our product and shed some light on the experience.&nbsp; We also contacted Reman at <a href="http://ohlife.com/">OhLife</a> to talk about running an email-heavy product.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ash Gupta of <a href="http://healthfinch.com/">Health Finch</a> gave us even more perspective on the interview.<p />  I'll admit I wasn't crazy about getting funded by YC at first considering how much time and effort we had already put in and how small of an investment YC would give us compared to our Friends and Family round.&nbsp; Since you have to go into the interview assuming you will get funded, I had to think hard about whether I wanted to give up some of the company to YC and move to SF.&nbsp; Ultimately I realized that YC would be a great time for us to focus on our product, receive excellent mentorship, be around some amazingly intelligent people, and potentially reach a lot of different customers.&nbsp; We didn't want to be a small company forever.<p />  For the next few weeks leading up to the interview we tried to have a clear definition of our product in our head, with a slew of possible questions we could get asked and the associated answers.&nbsp; We feared we would get absolutely grilled, so we made sure we were prepared.&nbsp; <p />  When we got the initial phone call from Harj, we thought it was just going to be a quick question and answer and we weren't really prepared for any tough questions.&nbsp; Harj was intense but friendly and had some hard questions for us.&nbsp; Our answers weren't that great and we made a point to work on them before the interview.&nbsp; We assumed the interview was going to be much more intense.<p />  When we walked into the offices of YC, about an hour before our interview, we didn't know what to expect.&nbsp; Everyone associated with the program (alumni, mentors, investors, etc.) seemed to be on a different level than anyone else, at least as projected by Hacker News.&nbsp; In reality, everyone in the big orange room was extremely friendly and I felt that we fit right in.&nbsp; It didn't matter what school we went to or where we might have worked, it just mattered that we built something people thought was cool and seemed like a viable product.&nbsp; We met YC Alumni <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/daniel-levine">Dan Levine</a> and <a href="http://alexisohanian.com/">Alexis Ohanian</a> who were both extremely friendly and very interested in what we were doing.&nbsp; Dan even gave Dan and I a ride to downtown Mountain View after the interview.<p />  When Jessica finally came out to invite us into the room we knew it was go time.&nbsp; With a good luck wish from Alexis we walked into the room and introduced ourselves.&nbsp; To our surprise, Paul remembered our idea and we quickly explained the concept.&nbsp; Basically, GoBuzz is a better Alerts product for business people.&nbsp; Jessica jumped right in and identified an obvious need for our product and expressed her frustration with the Google Alerts she was currently managing.&nbsp; We talked through our current market and how we planned to expand.&nbsp; The transition to the demo was smooth and everyone seemed excited about what we built.&nbsp; We even surprised and impressed Paul that our Natural Language Processing was so good that it identified all the people and companies in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/12/y-combinator-names-first-new-partners-since-2005-paul-buchheit-and-harj-taggar">an article about YC</a> that we used for our demo.&nbsp; Through the NLP feature, a user could import new contacts and companies into their GoBuzz list for future monitoring based on other articles they found relevant.<p />  After the interview we had our picture taken and went back to the room feeling good.&nbsp; The interview went very well and to our surprise we were not grilled at all.&nbsp; In fact, it was nothing compared to some of the mentor meetings and investment talks we have had in Wisconsin which had definitely hardened us.<p />  Despite the fact that the team thought our product was "clearly" better than Google Alerts, they thought our product had too high of customer acquisition costs and too low of a price point to leave us with big enough margins.&nbsp; I respected how thoughtful and accurate their response was given how many startups they were interviewing.&nbsp; I think it was our fault to not give enough possible alternative paths for our product that could have given us a leaner product with bigger margins.&nbsp; One idea we had but never got to in the interview was to be a "people and company alerts" service so companies like <a href="http://etacts.com">Etacts</a>, for example, could use our API and service to provide their customers with relevant news and web alerts on top of their contact management product.&nbsp; Extending traditional CRMs like Salesforce was another option (though that would put us in their proprietary "open cloud").<p />  Dan and I had some good soul searching in the hotel later that night and realized that what Paul had said was not new to us.&nbsp; We had been having trouble staying lean while also making sure we were finding enough news for our customers and making sure it was relevant without requiring too much work on the part of the end user.&nbsp; We were trying to solve a tough problem (which I believe we were better at than most similar services) and not making our customers happy enough and often enough was draining.&nbsp; We ultimately decided it was best to shut down the service and move on to bigger and better things, taking our experience with us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think there is still a void left where GoBuzz and other similar services were trying to make a mark.&nbsp; So many great products like Xobni, Rapportive, or Etacts, can tell you <em>how </em>or periodically <em>when </em>to reach out to your customers, but none of them tell you <em>why</em> you should.&nbsp; That breaking news story, the award, the bankruptcy, the death.&nbsp; There is a big need for a product to solve this problem well and to respect the professional market it could thrive in.&nbsp; We always considered Gist the biggest competitor but lately they seem to be targeting those already comfortable with social media noise which I think misses the mark.</p>
<p>In short, the YC experience was amazing and made me realize how <em>possible</em> it is to be the next Facebook or Twitter.&nbsp; We were interviewing with the best of the best in the tech community and I believe we performed well.&nbsp; It was a huge confidence booster that I will take with me into my future projects.&nbsp; I hope to interview with YC again with whatever project I happen on next (maybe <a href="http://getfready.com/">Fready</a>?)</p>
<p>The biggest advice I have for future interviewees is to respect YC but don't put them on a pedestal.&nbsp; If you are invited for an interview you deserve to be there.&nbsp; If you weren't, focus on building a product people want and don't dwell on the rejection.&nbsp; Believe your product can be mentioned with just as much respect as Facebook.&nbsp; I've been told the difference between those in Silicon Valley and those in the Midwest is that people in Silicon Valley think big.&nbsp; I think it's because they are not as far removed from tech legends as others.&nbsp; They believe they can fight in the same arena because they have seen others just like them do it time and time again.&nbsp; They believe in the possibility of it all.</p>
<p>If you were like us and didn't make it past the interview, then your company is by no means dead. While YC was our Last Hurrah that reaffirmed some of our previous concerns with the business, you might see it as a minor setback. Either way I'm sure you will cherish the experience just like we did.</p>
