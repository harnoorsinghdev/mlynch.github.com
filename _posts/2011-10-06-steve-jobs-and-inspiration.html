    <div>Like most techies, the news of Steve Job's passing has saddened me more than I expected. &nbsp;I will greatly miss him and his influence on the world.</div>
<p />
<div>Though I love most of my Apple products, I don't think seeing him up on stage announcing the next iProduct will be what I miss most about him.</div>
<p />
<div>Steve is an inspiration, and he taught us that one of the best things we can do is to inspire other people. &nbsp;We don't have to create the next Apple, earn tons of money, or change entire industries. &nbsp;We have to take risks, try new things, be inspiring to those who wish they could make a change in their lives.</div>
<p />
<div>I want to do things that are hard and to do them well and to love it. I want to conquer my fears and grow each and every day and inspire others to do the same, no matter how small their impact is on the rest of the world.</div>
<p />
<div>That is how I want to be remembered, and I thank Steve for inspiring me.</div>
