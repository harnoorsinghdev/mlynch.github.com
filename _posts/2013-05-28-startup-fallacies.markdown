Over the last few months I've chatted with some random entrepreneurs on the web that have fallen prey to fallacies of building a software startup. 

__#1: Stealth Mode__

"Stealth mode" basically means you aren't sharing your idea with anyone besides your team until you launch publicly. Generally if you are serious you'll also ask potential employees and investors to sign NDAs before you talk to them about what you are doing.

The only time stealth mode is okay is if you are strategically attacking a competitor and you want to have fun by surprising them. I've done that and it's definitely fun!

__#2: Scaling__

You don't need to even *think* about scaling until you are hitting the limits of capacity. That's what we call a "good problem to have," meaning you have a challenge that has come from a clear opportunity.
