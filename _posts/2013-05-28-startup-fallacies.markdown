Over the last few months I've chatted with some random entrepreneurs on the web that have fallen prey to various fallacies of starting a software startup.

The early stages of a startup's life are not the same as later stages. The first year is all about proving you have something viable, and the following fallacies work in direct opposition to that goal.

__#1: Stealth Mode__

"Stealth mode" basically means you aren't sharing your idea with anyone besides your team until you launch publicly. Sometimes if you are really serious/crazy you'll also ask potential employees and investors to sign NDAs before you talk to them about what you are doing.

Don't do this. It's amazing how few people actually care about your idea, and fewer that can and will drop everything and try to beat you at your own game. If you are trying to hire, this is a big red flag you aren't able to discern what truly matters in business.

Also, savvy investors won't sign your NDA, and those are the investors you want.

The only time stealth mode is okay is if you are strategically attacking a competitor and you want to have fun by surprising them. Now that's definitely fun!

__#2: It's Not Perfect Yet__

Perfection is the enemy of the seed stage of a startup's life. It's amazing how understanding and patient early adopters are when they see the *makings* of an idea being executed upon that solves a problem they have.

These early adopters will help promote your vision and bring others on board. Many of them will give you money earlier than others will. Enable them to be your biggest fans.

__#3: You Need a Business Guy__

If you are a developer and you think you need a business guy to get off the ground, you are probably wrong. It's amazing what a smart nerd can accomplish. Treat it like a game and try to find the optimal strategy for winning that game. Pop the bubble of your developer world where no one ever pays for anything, and participate in a world where people do.

__#4: You Need a Developer__

On the other hand, if you are a non-techie and you think all you need is a dev to get your product off the ground, you are probably falling prey to fallacy #3: with all the [great tools](http://drifty.com/) out there today you can build something that tests your idea on early customers without being a developer.

And as a bonus point, if you can show the passion and ability to make this product come to life on a shoestring budget you will probably find it easier to attract a technical co-founder.

__#5: You Need Money__

It's amazing how little money you need these days to start a SaaS business. For example, you can test your idea for free on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) and then scale up if you are lucky enough to have demand.

You don't need investors, you don't need incubators, you just need personal passion, skill, and the ability to hustle and find customers.

You can also build your startup while keeping your day job. A few hours every night goes a long ways.

__#6: Small Can't Be Big__

Back when [Drifty](http://drifty.com/) was only making a few thousand dollars per month, I had a few people put me down and tell me that wasn't much and that we would have to do something different.

Not soon after we were doing considerably more and disproved that.

If you have customers paying you and they love your products, you have a big opportunity to build a real business on it.

Start small, grow big (if you even want to!)

__#7: Take All Advice__

As a rule, I am skeptical of all advice (yes, I see the irony). The truth is that advice comes from personal biases and experiences, and many successful people distil their success down to inaccurate talking points.

Take all advice and opinions you receive and treat them as data points. Refer to them as you follow your gut, but don't take them as truth until you've tested and validated them.

__More?__

This is a small list. Feel free to share any other fallacies early-stage startups fall victim to below.
