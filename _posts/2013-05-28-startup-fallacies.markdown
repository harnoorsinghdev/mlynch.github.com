Over the last few months I've chatted with some random entrepreneurs on the web that have fallen prey to fallacies of *starting* a software startup.

__#1: Stealth Mode__

"Stealth mode" basically means you aren't sharing your idea with anyone besides your team until you launch publicly. Sometimes if you are really serious/crazy you'll also ask potential employees and investors to sign NDAs before you talk to them about what you are doing.

Don't do this. It's amazing how few people actually care about your idea, and fewer that can and will drop everything and try to beat you at your own game.

The only time stealth mode is okay is if you are strategically attacking a competitor and you want to have fun by surprising them. I've done that and it's definitely fun!

__#2: Scaling__

You don't need to even *think* about scaling until you are hitting the limits of capacity. That's what we call a "good problem to have," meaning you have a challenge that has come from a clear opportunity.

__#3: Perfection__

Perfection is the enemy of the seed stage of a startup's life. It's amazing how understanding and patient early adopters are when they see the *makings* of an idea being executed upon that solves a problem they have.

Don't worry if it's not perfect, or if it has bugs you haven't worked out yet. As long as you can get early adopters on board with your vision that is a great start.

__#4: Business Guys__

If you are a developer and you think you need a business guy to get off the ground, you are probably wrong. It's amazing what a smart nerd can accomplish. Treat it like a game and try to find the optimal strategy for winning that game.

__#4: Developers__

On the other hand, if you are a non-techie and you think all you need is a dev to get your product off the ground, you are probably falling prey to fallacy #3: with all the [great tools](http://drifty.com/) out there today you can build something that tests your idea on early customers without being a developer.

And as a bonus point, if you can show the passion and ability to make this product come to life on a shoestring budget you will probably find it easier to attract a technical co-founder.

__#5: Money__

It's amazing how little money you need these days to start a SaaS business. For example, you can test your idea for free on [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) and then scale up if you are lucky enough to have demand.

You don't need investors, you don't need incubators, you just need personal passion, skill, and the ability to hustle and find customers.

You can also build your startup while keeping your day job. A few hours every night goes a long ways.
