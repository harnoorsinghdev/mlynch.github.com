I recently found out about the awesome little book [Strengths Finder 2.0](http://www.amazon.com/dp/159562015X/?tag=googhydr-20&hvadid=8045098284&hvpos=1t1&hvexid=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1146753244203994208&hvpone=13.27&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&ref=pd_sl_ed0zidzzj_b), which helps you analyze yourself and find your strengths, in order to help you develop them further. It's about focusing on what you are good at, and less about where you fall short.

Among other realizations, Strengths Finder pointed out that I might be strong in the Belief theme.

This shocked me, since generally I don't find "belief" very interesting as it pertains to spirituality. I'm a staunch atheist, and I find the scientific and physical world far more exciting and full of wonder and truth than religion. 

However, I think belief is actually a really strong driver in my life, and I just didn't understand what it really meant until now.

Why am I doing this?
--------------------

According to Tom Rath, author of Strengths Finder 2.0

> If you possess a strong Belief theme, you have certain core values that are enduring...it also demands that you find work that meshes with your values. Your work must be meaningful; it must matter to you.

When I think about that explanation of the Belief theme, I find it matches quite a bit with what drives me.

Here are three beliefs that drive me in my business and personal pursuits:

__1. We are all capable of self-empowerment. We are able to create real value and be self sufficient on our own, outside of societal norms and corporate structure.__

The technical revolution has given us a very large opportunity for self-empowerment. I believe very strongly that each one of us is capable of creating and sharing with the world something of unique value. I am inspired to help enable more people to make their mark on the world.

I also believe too many people spend too much time doing things they don't love. It's not easy to do what you love and make a living from it, though. In fact, it's really damn hard. 

I strongly believe if we invest in practical entrepreneurship education from childhood through adulthood, we will have more people being self-sufficient while doing what they love. I think the world would also be a more interesting and happy place to live.

This belief is partly what drove me to start [Madison Iterators](http://madisoniterators.com/), a weekly meetup of creators and entrepreneurs. I believe support systems are crucial in helping us become more self-sufficient, and we need more of them.

__2. Scientific understanding is under-appreciated but increasingly important.__

I like to think of this more as a fact than a belief, but the lack of scientific knowledge in the world is a problem I want to help solve.

It's amazing what things like Reddit are doing to bring enlightenment to more people around the world. I want to help make Science more appreciated in our society and a bigger driver of behavior in government and daily life.

I believe that understanding how the world works makes us more conscious of how our actions impact everything around us, and help us explain things that were previously mysterious.

We don't have to look far for examples where a lack of understanding of science has had severe negative impacts on our society and ecosystems.

I believe we can make science more approachable and easier to understand, and that this is the responsibility of all of us.

__3. Authenticity will be one of the most important economic drivers in the future__

Brands are starting to get this, but we are quite a ways off. Gone are the days consumers are okay buying products from faceless companies with no authentic personality or moral structure.

The most successful companies are okay taking risks to engage with their customers, and to form real connections with them.

In my current company, my co-founder [Ben](http://bensperry.com/) and I strive to be authentic and real. We say sorry when we're sorry. We are honest even when the truth sucks. We take time to have real conversations with our customers. 

It's not always natural to communicate personality across a product boundary, but it's a skill worth learning. Sales, marketing, talent acquisition, and employee happiness depend on it.

Believe in something. Work towards it.
--------------------------------------

I believe that life is too precious to waste it doing things that don't matter to you. Regardless of what beliefs you have that motivate you, try to incorporate them into your job, your relationships, and your approach to learning.

Belief doesn't have to be religious or spiritual. It can simply be a set of values that motivate you more than shallow pursuits.

Go out there and believe in something...and then do it.
