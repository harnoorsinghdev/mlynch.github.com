    I always tell myself I need to start blogging. I'll start a new blog every few months and just let it go. I like to write, but I like to program and run my <a href="http://gobuzz.com/">company</a> more, so it takes a backseat. <p /> So, in an effort to just put something out there, I've decided to enumerate the kind of technologies and tools I've been working with lately, hoping to generate a starting point for a future post: <p /> Right now I'm working on search systems with Solr and Lucene. In addition I've been doing some crawling with Nutch. The Apache projects have done more to help my business grow and to provide me with a strong foundation of well written software than anything else I've ever used. On top of that I use python and django for web application development. For data storage, I use PostgreSQL but lately I've really been ejoying MongoDB, simply because it is so easy to use "on the fly" and has really pythonic libraries. Performance for my use case has been identical if not better (I shouldn't say that without proof) than psql. I wouldn't call myself a fanboy of anything, I just like software that works and libraries that are easy to use and powerful. I am also interested in taking software and making it useful for the end user. <p /> Perhaps one of these topics will become a future post.
