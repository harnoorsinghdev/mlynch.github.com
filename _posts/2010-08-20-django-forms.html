    Lately I've noticed myself using Django Forms less and less often.&nbsp; I do like being able to automatically validate and handle form errors, and I like the structure of creating a python class to represent a form.&nbsp; However, I almost never use the django form output methods (as_p or as_table), and whenever I need to do something even the tiniest bit custom, I find myself having to dig through documentation and create custom form widgets.<p />I think it's just faster to do it by hand and have complete control over the form.
