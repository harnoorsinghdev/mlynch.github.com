    <p>I used to think programming was magic. Drawing shapes, interacting with 3d objects, sorting a list of numbers, or making a user interface,&nbsp; they all seemed to be divine feats.&nbsp; As a 12 year old, I felt that programming was too hard and that I would never be smart enough to figure it out. It's a testament to the amount of time I spent on the computer that I became so bored with normal computing tasks I forced myself to learn how to program, ignoring the magic I was unable to perform.&nbsp; Fast forward to today: I'm a recent CS graduate and I program almost every single day (and night). <p /> My CS education showed me the incredible feats of the human mind, but it also came with an increasing sense of magic and inferiority.&nbsp; "Did you know a bloom filter could help you quickly test set membership with a high degree of probability? Or that KMP can enable you to search through text far more quickly than a naive approach?"&nbsp; I worried what else I was doing naively that someone far more intelligent than I was doing much better.<p />Right before graduating, I started my first company. We indexed millions of documents and searched for references to client contact lists and their business interests. I had to build websites, backend indexing and searching systems, databases that could handle even our small amount of traffic given our corpus, and above all I had to make something our customers wanted to use and pay for. Stuff I had never done and never thought I could do. I learned many valuable things during that time, but some of the most important ones have forever impacted my relationship with programming.<p />I've been reflecting on my progress as a software product developer lately, and what I believe programming will become for me in the future. The only answer I have is "more work."&nbsp; Gone are the days where I didn't know how I might come up with a way to detect a click on a sphere in a 3d scene, or implement a drag-and-drop interface, or index millions of documents.&nbsp; These days, I put in long hours connecting structures that I've built before or that others have built for me. The fantasy of the medium is gone, but I love programming more now than I ever did.&nbsp; Software is a challenging and rewarding adventure that my brain is lucky enough to experience, not just a house of cards I have to expend energy to build just to keep from falling. I've mastered the instrument, now I love learning how to truly play it.<p /> I used to believe I would learn a better way to iterate over a list of items.&nbsp; One that would be extremely fast and anything but naive.&nbsp; This algorithm would let me fill a hash table with generic data without hashing each key, or sum a list of non-formulaic numbers, processing each item without having to actually visit it.&nbsp; I felt stupid every time I used a for-loop.<p /> I thought software was magic.&nbsp; I was in awe of the power the computer had.&nbsp; I thought computers didn't have constraints on resources that mere life on Earth did. I forgot to build respect for the humans that had created it and certainly obeyed such restrictions. <p /> I've found that the most realistic approach to software is the most rewarding:&nbsp; Software is hard work, but programming is easy.&nbsp; Sometimes you are working on a novel approach to an old problem, and sometimes you are building a worthwhile experience for a user.&nbsp; There are no shortcuts, and there are no cop-outs. Smart, hardworking people build great software, and so do average, hard working people. To make great software you can be one or the other, but not neither.<p /> Accepting that often you <em>only</em> have to iterate and check every element in a list has helped me face problems with a confident attitude.&nbsp; No more debilitating awe or worship of the machine or software running on it.&nbsp; I am the master of the tool and only I am responsible for what I create with it.&nbsp; Become comfortable again with quick and simple and focus on the unsolved dream.<p /> <em>Now back to work...</em></p>
