    Today I figured out what the postgresql transactions that were idle and waiting yet keeping me from running an ALTER TABLE were from: I was running Django's manage.py shell application.&nbsp; I quit out of it and the transation completed.&nbsp; I use select * from pg_stat_activity to see what queries or transactions are currently running on the database.
