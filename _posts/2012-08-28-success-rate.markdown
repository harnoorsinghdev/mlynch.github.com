Over 93% of startups fail...right? You have two choices then: either not even bother, or go really big. Like really *fucking* big. Facebook big. Shit, BIGGER than facebook big.

Or maybe 84% of startups fail because so many are starting "startups" not based on any sound economics. Another social sharing app, or a website to change yet another of our regretable habits. Thinking that business is a popularity contest and this is high school all over again. Listening to TechCrunch and thinking if you can just convince an investor to give you their money you'll have a gigantic exit and can skip the whole profit part.

I'm sick of this. Startups don't have to fail in such large numbers. Why do we keep making the same mistakes? If not even [Like a Little](http://lal.com/) which supposedly had a "virality index...higher than Facebook's in their fastest growth stage" could build a big social product, why do we keep thinking we'll be able to?

The best way to build a real business has not changed for centuries, and the formula is incredibly simple: _Make something people want, charge for it, and scale it up._

It's not easy. In fact, it's fucking *hard*. But we live in a time of unprecedented personal empowerment. Each and every one of us is capable of turning our passions into products and building sustainable businesses on them. You can't build a sustainable business without money, so why build a product that doesn't build revenue right in?

I want to see *more* people succeeding in running their own company. But it's so hard when so many jump right back into the wrong formula.

It's time to ignore this statistic. Take it from 37signals: "Don't get fooled by the stats. Other people's failures are just that: other peoples failures. If other people can't market their product, it has nothing to do with you."

Get out there and *sell*.
