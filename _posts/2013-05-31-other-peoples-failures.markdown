In the startup world, there is this "statistic" that 9 in 10 startups fail. I don't know where the hell it came from, but it's a very convenient stat thrown around by investors, entrepreneurs, and the media.

I recently found a [Quora discussion](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-truth-behind-9-out-of-10-startups-fail) on the topic which explores the truth behind the stat.

The stat is essentially bullshit and shouldn't be taken seriously.

One of my favorite business books, Rework, discusses the concept of failure as a "rite of passage" - something expected in the business world that you are either in that lucky 10% or you're a fuck up.

Other people’s failures are just that: other people’s failures.
