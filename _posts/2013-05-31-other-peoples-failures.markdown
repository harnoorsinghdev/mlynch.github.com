In the startup world, there is this "statistic" that 9 in 10 startups fail. I don't know where the hell it came from, but it's a very convenient stat thrown around by investors, entrepreneurs, and the media that helps give startups an air of extreme risk and uncertainty.

I recently found a [Quora discussion](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-truth-behind-9-out-of-10-startups-fail) on the topic which explores the truth behind the stat. Conclusion? The stat is essentially bullshit, but emerges from self-interested slicing of small data sets.

One of my favorite business books, [Rework](http://37signals.com/rework), discusses the concept of failure as a "rite of passage" - something expected in the business world that you are either in that lucky 10% or you're a fuck up.

I've taken one quote in particular to heart: 

> "Don't get fooled by the stats. Other people’s failures are just that: other people’s failures."

Your startup doesn't have to fail. It's not all up to chance. There are certain things you can do to improve your chances of success.


At the end of the day though, the one trap that few first time entrepreneurs don't see is your constantly rising expectations.
