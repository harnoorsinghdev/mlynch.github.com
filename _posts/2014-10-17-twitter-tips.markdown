I notice far too many startups that just plain get Twitter wrong. They spam, they follow way too many people, and they don't produce interesting content.

It's a tragedy because if done well, Twitter can be one of the best sources for *free*, *high quality* and *viral* traffic for your new product.

While Twitter isn't right for every startup, depending on the target market it can a huge advantage for new startups just getting off the ground.

##1. Don't spam

Don't tweet random accounts telling them about your product. Certainly don't tweet celebrities or tweet at random people
following a certain trending topic that has nothing to do with your business.

I've seen too many startups do this. It makes you look desperate, but worst of all it pisses off the organic follows you've already gotten as it fills
their stream with your spam!

##2. Mind the dot

When tweeting at someone, use a "." before if you want others to see it. If you just do `@maxlynch hey Max! Check out my new product` only those
who follow both you and I will see that. Change it to `.@maxlynch` to avoid that.

##3. Don't mass follow

A lot of people do "mass follows" in attempt to get follows back. It doesn't really work and there is a limit to how many you can follow anyways.

##4. Don't buy follows

Buying follows seems like an easy way to increase your importance. But you'll have no engagement on any of your content and
you will actually *lose* followers over time. It's dishonest and lame, but might impress someone who is too stupid
or careless to check into the validity of your audience.

##5. Create unique content

The best way to get followers and grow a popular twitter account is by blogging unique content and getting
important people to see it and retweet it. Often that means just mentioning other accounts. I think this is totally okay to do
and can work well, but might not the first time. An example:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Install <a href="https://twitter.com/Android">@android</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/apachecordova">@apachecordova</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Ionicframework">@Ionicframework</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/nodejs">@nodejs</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/ubuntu">@ubuntu</a> 14.04 x64 and x86 with a single script. <a href="http://t.co/KaVgWOGEQd">http://t.co/KaVgWOGEQd</a> RT</p>&mdash; Nic Raboy (@nraboy) <a href="https://twitter.com/nraboy/status/513695876045225984">September 21, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This is an Ionic community member that consistently creates quality content. Because he mentions us each time, we often retweet his stuff
and he's happy with the additional traffic and is growing his own audience.

##6. Do encourage follows externally

If you are able to do like Nic does above and generate quality content that drives traffic, make sure you are
encouraging those visitors to follow. An example from Ionic is our mailing list signup thank you page. Every visitor
that signs up for our mailing list is encouraged to share, follow, and star us:

##7. Be patient

The [@ionicframework](http://twitter.com/ionicframework) account has grown from 0 followers to 12,000 at the time of this writing, in a year.

Some days it feels like growth has completely stopped. Other days we gain hundreds of followers overnight.

Looking at a graph of our followers over time, we are growing better than linearlly, so each new engaged follower helps expand
the network and increase the rate of growth in follows.

Best of luck!
