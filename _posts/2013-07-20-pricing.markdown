When I launched my last two products on Hacker News, I got the requisite Patrick McKenzie [scolding](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3733692) and [shame](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4572262) for planning to charge too little.

At the time, I didn't realize what was possible in the SaaS business. I wasn't really confident anyone would pay much more than $10/mo for a product I wasn't sure was that useful to people.

Ignoring patio's advice and listening to my own ignorance, we launched [Codiqa](http://codiqa.com/) at a $10/mo price point, with a $30/mo unlimited plan.

I learned quickly that people do pay for things they find valuable. Count that as one of my first lessons learned in business.

I also learned that one's relationship with money changes as it starts to become disconnected from a personal savings account. Businesses see money as a tool to exchange value, always thinking about the potential profit on top of the cost, and employees that spend for a business are not spending their own money.

It was no surprise to me then, when we raised our prices, that people still bought (even more so!) and we made more money.

But over time, I realized that one of the most important reasons for charging and charging *enough* is simply because anything else isn't worth it.

Since your time is incredibly valuable and there are always opportunity costs, charging too little means you are setting yourself up to be underwhelmed as time goes on.

Making a couple thousand dollars a month sounds great at first, but it won't be satisfying after a few months.

Charging just $5 to $10/mo for most companies just isn't enough.

I realized there are so many great ideas out there, that if I can't charge and make a lot of from the ones I spend most of my time on, I won't enjoy working on them.

This might sound cynical, or greedy. But really it's just an understanding of the *potential* we all have to build meaningful companies that can grow with our ever-rising expectations.

Luckily, my [current company](http://drifty.com/) fits into the category I like. There is a lot of opportunity in empowering people to build the ideas they dream of.

But now I make sure that we never undersell ourselves, because anything less than our potential is a great waste.

So if you are launching a product, or have one that is just bumbling along, charge more and make sure you are putting your time into something that can grow to satisfy you and your team.
