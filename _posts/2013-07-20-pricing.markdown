When I launched my last two products on Hacker News, I got the requisite Patrick McKenzie [scolding](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3733692) and [shame](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4572262) for planning to charge too little.

At the time, I didn't really realize what was possible in the SaaS business. I wasn't really confident anyone would pay much more than $10/mo for a product I wasn't sure was that useful to people.

Ignoring patio's advice and listening to my own ignorance, we launched [Codiqa](http://codiqa.com/) at a $10/mo price point, with a $30/mo unlimited plan.

I learned quickly that people do pay for things they find valuable. Count that as one of my first lessons learned in business.

I also learned that one's relationship with money changes as it starts to become disconnected from a personal savings account. Businesses see money as a tool to exchange value, always thinking about the potential profit on top of the cost.

In your personal life, you don't really "make" money the way businesses do. Someone gives you a paycheck every month and it doesn't change all that much. Even if you are a founder, you are still probably on payroll if you run an averge C or S Corp company.
