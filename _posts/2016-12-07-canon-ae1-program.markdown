There's something both absurd and wonderful about writing a review for a camera that is more than 35 years old, built before I was even born. While much of what I have to say probably repeats volumes of reviews of the camera from 1981, my experiences with it as a child of the digital age with camera technology that would seem out of science fiction to someone in the 80s, makes it unique.
