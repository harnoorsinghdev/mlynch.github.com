There's something absurd about writing a review for a camera that is more than 35 years old, built before I was even born. While much of what I have to say probably repeats volumes of reviews of the camera from 1981, my experiences with it as a child of the digital age with camera technology that would seem out of science fiction to someone in the 80s, gives me an interesting opportunity to hopefully say something new about it.

Also, there are people out there, like me, that are just discovering a love for film photography in 2016. To them, all of these classic cameras are new.

A few months ago I wrote about my new found [film photography obsession](http://maxlynch.com/blog/film-photography), after having acquired my dad's Minolta SRT 100 from the early 70s. After shooting many rolls of film with that camera, I felt like it was time to get my *own* 35mm film camera, and maybe upgrade a little in the process.

I stumbled on the Canon AE-1 Program, the updated version of the classic Canon AE-1, one of the most popular SLR cameras ever created. An ebay vendor was selling a lot of near-mint AE-1 Program's, and seeing as I wasn't interested in getting yet another broken vintage camera, I ponied up ~$130 for the body and the Canon FD 50mm 1.8 lens.

After getting used to it, I really love this camera, despite some of the quirks and the annoying metering system.

First, the good. The 1/1000 shutter speed is a welcome change from my Minolta with only 1/500. The shutter is loud but incredibly satisfying. The film advance feels *so* good. The viewfinder is enormous, bigger than my Fujifilm X-E2S digital camera. The focusing prism is bright and I find I hit the focus way more than before. The FD lens is sufficiently sharp and the aperture ring is satisfying.

For the not so good, I find the program modes *combined with* the metering system to be sufficiently obscure to be useless. For example, switch the shutter speed to Program and the aperture to manual, and the metering system prints out aperture values.
