There's something both absurd and wonderful about writing a review for a camera that is more than 35 years old, built before I was even born. While much of what I have to say probably repeats volumes of reviews of the camera from 1981, my experiences with it as a child of the digital age with camera technology that would seem out of science fiction to someone in the 80s, gives me an interesting opportunity to hopefully say something new about it.

A few months ago I wrote about my new found [film photography obsession](http://maxlynch.com/blog/film-photography), after having acquired my dad's Minolta SRT 100 from the early 70s.
