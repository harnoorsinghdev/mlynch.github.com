Technical would-be startup founders often feel pressured to have a "business guy" as a co-founder in order to get their startup off the ground. Even if the domain knowledge of the product comes from their own knowledge and experience.

In many other industries, this just isn't the case. Let's say you love making candy, and you are really fucking good at making candy. You decide to turn your passion into a business in order to really do the work you love. Chances are, if your product takes off, you'll be the decision maker and Benevolent Dictator for Life of your company.

I think it's better that way. You know your product inside and out. If anyone engages you in a discussion about the product, you'll be able to yap their ears off for hours on end. Your passion rubs off on anyone that you share your product with. You don't have to rehearse your pitch and you can answer tough questions with insight.

Even if you hate business or socializing and you despise those aspects of running a company, you will most likely be a more effective leader of your company than someone else who might have more traditional business skills but doesn't really "get" what your product is or what it's capable of. And trust me, you can ignore the uptight business bullshit and still build a real company.

If you are capable of making something, just fucking make it. You don't need a business person to get it off the ground, and you sure as hell don't need a business plan. You are smart and intelligent and I'm sure you can figure out how to wire up a credit card form to make money from it. If it makes sense to bring in extra domain knowledge as you expand, do it then, after you've built and tested your idea with actual customers.

On the flip side, if you are writing a lot of software for a product you don't really get or feel a connection with, go work on something else. Chances are there's a niche out there waiting for your brand of passion and skill, and you and the world will be better off for it.

I want to see more people that make the bread selling it. Think of all the companies you admire, chances are most of them are lead by passionate people who truly love working on their products, not just a CEO reading a script and collecting a paycheck. 

These leaders might be [quirky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) or [lack superb social skills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page), but we can't help but be infected with their passion and energy.
