It's hard to build a tech company when you don't have creators on the core team. Having business people isn't enough, because product is huge and there is no business to work on until your product gets off the ground. Unless they're a great marketer or growth hacker, or can close deals left and right, a business person will likely find themselves spinning their wheels at this stage.

Not to mention if you have to outsource something so core to your business, you are already at a huge disadvantage.

I'm a huge fan of technical or creative/designer founders. I think smart people can learn to run a company, even if they weren't business inclined before. And you don't have to like any of the classic business bullshit to be good at it.

Unfortunately, creators often get cherry picked from outside of the state, never to return again. I've seen the typical cycle happen too many times, and it goes something like this: founder starts startup, startup fails because founder had no clue what they were doing, founder gets well paying job, founder leaves city.

Since the bay area has lots of high-paying companies hiring these people, and does an amazing job cultivating these non-business founders, many of them wind up there, quit their jobs, and start a company there.

But I actually think this problem is a good sign for Madison and for other cities, since it suggests that quality is far more important than things like location, access to investors, etc.

So what can we do about it? I think we have to start with the University. Unfortunately, many professors still hold the belief that you need to be in the bay area to start a startup, and often tell their students this. I've had a professor tell me that, as well. My only guess is it's a holdover from the dot-com era. I will now make a point to call them out on this where possible.

I'm a CS person, so I'd love to see more collaboration with the startup community and the CS department. It's starting to improve, but we have a long ways to go. I believe these students are the ones who are going to run the internet startups of tomorrow. Unfortunately, the business school gets more attention in Madison but I think that's wrong.

To do my part, I want to help technical people start companies. Whether that means helping them get over their insecurity about not being a business person, or just how to channel their creative energy into making a company, I want to help. If you are one of these people, please <a href="mailto:max@drifty.com">email me</a> whenever, I'd love to talk!

A city that draws so many smart people to it every year has a ton of potential. I think we have a very bright future in Madison and I'm happy to be a part of it.
