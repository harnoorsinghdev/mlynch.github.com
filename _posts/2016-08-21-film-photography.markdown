Recently, I've become utterly obsessed with shooting Film. Earlier this year, I acquired my dad's old Minolta SRT 100 as my family was cleaning out some old things, a 50mm Rokkor f2.0 lens, and a long-since expired Kodak Gold 400 roll half-shot and still in the camera. In the span of 6 months I've gone on to shoot, develop, and scan over 50 rolls.

Film is one of those hard things for people to understand in the digital age. It's essentially buying
storage to store a fixed, and very limited number of "files" (images, in this case). On top of that, the storage medium has to be
handled delicately and then processed with various chemicals before it can be worked with. After that,
the images are generally scanned (perhaps the slowest part of the process) and then printed digitally or touched up with Photoshop (unless you're
working in a darkroom to make traditional prints).

Compare that to the digital workflow: take photo, optionally apply a filter. It's easy to see why digital people just don't understand film.

I grew up just as digital was starting to emerge, so I still remember when family and
friends shot film because buying a digital camera meant purchasing a sub-par device for too much money. Film
was just better and ruled as the photography economy of scale.

The weird thing about the pre-digital film era was that many people were shooting with crappy auto film cameras. Kinda like most people shoot with crappy smartphone cameras today. My dad's Minolta SRT 100 from 1970 was superior in almost every single way to any camera my family owned until someone in the family bought a Canon DSLR in the mid 2000's.

In that sense, using an old, manual film camera like the Minolta felt like I was rediscovering a lost art. Being fully manual, the camera expected me to understand the tradeoffs between Aperture, Shutter Speed, and ISO, and also how to configure each one for additional creative control. I had some experience with this with my Canon DSLR but given the priority modes on a modern DSLR, it was rare I had to really think about it. Not to mention the challenge of having a fixed ISO for a given roll! Having to learn how to master a manual camera has made me a much better photographer.

On top of the manual approach, I've thoroughly enjoyed discovering and understanding the various film available today. When I first picked up the Minolta and searched for film, I expected that the entire industry was dead and that I just had a nice antique on my hands. What I found pleasantly surprised me: not only was new film being made in 2016, but modern film was some of the best film around. Additionally, new companies were trying to "bring film back" by either repackaging existing films, or investing in new film stocks. With the Kickstarter era and the major film enthusiast community, I'm confident film will be here for a long time regardless of whether the major brands fade.

So far, I've shot Kodak Portra 400, Kodak Ektar 100, Gold 100/200/400, Kodak Tri-x 400, Ilford HP5, Ilford Delta 3200 and 100, Fujifilm Fujicolor/Superia/Provia, Lomography color 800 and 100, Lomography Lady Gray 400, and Fomapan 100. Of all those choices, I've settled on Portra 400 as my absolute favorite for color negative, Ilford HP5+ for black and white, and Provia for slide (though I have a Velvia roll waiting to be shot).

Here are some samples of each:

If you had to pick one film stock to buy today, I absolutely recommend Portra 400. It's affordable (5 rolls for $35), the colors are unmatched, it's pretty fast, and it has one of the largest latitudes of color film meaning it looks good underexposed _and_ overexposed (within reason). A close second would be Superia. For black and white, Ilford HP5+ can be easily processed as if it was shot at 800, 1600, or 3200 ISO making it incredibly flexible. If you are able to do E-6 processing cheaply, then Provia is a no-brainer and is absolutely gorgeous if slightly difficult to nail the exposure with.

After I had my camera, and found some interesting film to try, I had to figure out where to get it developed. First, I checked Walgreens because I had gotten some digital prints there and heard they still did film development. It turns out that they still develop film today, but they don't return negatives so I could only hope to get some prints back. The worker at the Photo lab at Walgreens recommended that I try the [Camera Company](http://www.cameracompany.com/) in Madison and it turned out there was a location blocks away from where I work.

Today, I get all my film developed at the Camera Company in Madison. At first, I was dismayed at the price for developing with prints and/or scans. In an effort to find a more economical way to shoot film, I looked into developing my own B&W film at home and buying a film scanner. However, their prices for develop-only were much more reasonable ($3.99 for color, $4.99 for B&W, per roll) and so now I just have them develop the film. I then bought a film scanner (the Epson V600) and so I scan at home, skipping the print process altogether. While I've also developed a few B&W rolls at home, I'm happy having the lab do it and I've settled on this workflow being the optimal in terms of time and cost (for me, at least).

When I was given the camera, I initially didn't know what to do with it and I had no reason to really use it over my DSLR. I randomly did some YouTube searching to find film people and see whether it was worth sinking time and money into. I happened upon Eduardo Pavez Goye and his awesome [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ProfetaParanoia). In particular, his [Shoot Film](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5VdEThfwM7GxqjiF5XkadZ6eDwlCd8-6) series showed me how easy film was to shoot, and how spectacular and unique the results were. To say that he singularly inspired me to get into shooting film isn't far from the truth. He also has some great videos on developing B&W film at home, and his process for developing and scanning film. If you want to get excited about shooting film and to see how others do it in 2016, take a look at his channel.

### Why I Love Film

Now that I have a workflow for film shooting and some stocks that I prefer, I am starting to understand why I enjoy shooting film and why I believe I will make it a life-long habit.

First of all is the sense of nostalgia a film photo gives me. When I was just starting to develop my taste for photography, I realized that nostalgia is a major part of why I shoot photos, and that film just oozes nostalgia. Perhaps it's the grain, perhaps it's the colors, and perhaps it's the bias for the kind of person that shoots film. Whatever it is, a great film photo moves me in ways that I can't seem to replicate with digital without tons of film-style editing. I am most drawn to film shooters on Flickr and I aspire to use the medium like they do.

I also enjoy the workflow, and this really is *the* deciding factor for those sticking with or eschewing film. I enjoy picking between film stocks that all seem to have various unique physical properties. I enjoy the limit to how many photos I can shoot on a roll. I enjoy dropping the film off at a lab. I enjoy spending hours scanning and touching up film. I enjoy the final product and I enjoy the work I put into making it.

Film feels like the first kind of traditional "art" passion I've ever had. Digital never felt like that to me, and I never had to spend much time with my digital photos beyond filtering through the thousands of duplicates I rattled off. Digital photography is certainly an artful medium, but I personally don't see myself as an artist with my digital photography.

To be fair, I still thoroughly enjoy digital, but I see it as a tool for those moments when resolution and pixel perfection are a must. For example, you can bet that I'll be shooting the first moments of my son's birth with my digital Fujifilm! What I found with film, though, was a pretty shocking realization that technical details like megapixels really don't matter in photography apart from supporting large format prints. I had to come up with a new framework for understanding the quality of a photo, and film fit perfectly within that.

Beyond nostalgia and workflow, I love the colors of film and the qualities of the bokeh effect. The colors are what I always want my digital photos to look like, but which I cannot really reproduce in Lightroom or VSCO. The bokeh is just wonderful, likely accentuated by the grain structure of most films, and film was just *made* for it. In my head all my photos, digital or otherwise, want to look like film!

Finally, I just love the surprise of film. I recently developed a roll that was four months old, and as I scanned it I had the biggest smile on my face seeing old moments for the first time. Each roll holds memories that I've since lost, just waiting to be rediscovered.

Whenever I travel, I bring both my digital Fujifilm XE2S *and* my Minolta SRT 100. I found that I always seem to end up just using the Minolta the whole time. I think that says a lot about shooting film. It's just more *fun*.

If you're reading this and even mildly intrigued by film, I recommend finding an old, used manual film camera. There are so many good ones on ebay right now! Grab some Portra or HP5 and shoot a few rolls. Sit on them a bit to let them build up meaning, go get them developed and scanned, and clean up dust in Photoshop. If you love the results, you might have just found a new obsession.

Keep shooting!
