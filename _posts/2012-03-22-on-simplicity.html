    One has achieved simplicity when they have created a unit product for a given problem. One 140 character messaging application, one single-button touch screen iOS based smartphone, one side-scroller game with a red-clothes Italian plumber.<p /> If you can look at your product and say that it embodies the escence of what your problem is, you have created something simple.  It can have many features, or just a few.  Like a fixed gear bike or or 21 speed road bike, based on the real-world requirements each is a simple solution to their respective task.<p /> When trying to create something simple, strive not to create something feature-less, but rather the emodiment of the requirements. If your product has grown outside of the required bounds, it may have lost its simplicity.<br /> <p /><div>What do you think? Is this how you view &quot;simple&quot; product development?</div>
