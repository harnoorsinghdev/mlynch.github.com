Over the last few months I've become frustrated with my nerd friends on Hacker News. It seems every Show HN or new launch brings with it predictable detraction.

These comments run the gamut from complaining about a Facebook login button to a video file that was 2.4MB in size. Generally all these comments suggest the project will utterly fail because of these things.

Many of these people seem to *want* to start a startup and make money selling things they've made. These preconceptions about what works and what doesn't when you are building a business are *just plain wrong*.
