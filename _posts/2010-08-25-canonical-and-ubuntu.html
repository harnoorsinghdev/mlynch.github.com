    <p>Today I started using Landscape from Canonical (<a href="https://landscape.canonical.com/)">https://landscape.canonical.com/)</a>. Basically you can register your Ubuntu Server with Canonical and administer and monitor it from a web application. Since I just started today I don't have any reviews of Landscape. However, my first impressions are that Landscape is a better and easier to use Linux server monitoring solution than anything else I've tried so far. <p /> I see a bright future for Canonical if it can keep providing these premium services on top of their already amazing Ubuntu distro. Especially with the growth of "Cloud Computing" or VPS hosting. One physical machine can host several virtual Ubuntu instances, potentially each subscribing to Canonical services.</p>
<p>Plus, they have about the best advertising spot in the planet for this market: The MOTD:</p>
