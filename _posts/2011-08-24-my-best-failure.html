<div>I'm speaking on the "Lessons Learned" panel for the <a href="http://ftf2011.com/" target="_blank">Forward Technology Festival</a> in Madison, WI this week. &nbsp;We will be discussing what we've learned from our failed startups. I've thought a little bit about why GoBuzz ultimately failed (see <a href="http://blog.maxlynch.com/my-y-combinator-interview-experience-and-a-go" target="_blank">my previous GoBuzz post-mortem</a>), but I haven't really dug in hard enough to analyze the whole situation. &nbsp;This blog post is a longer version of my&nbsp;preparatory&nbsp;notes for the panel.</div>
<p />
<div>Just as background: GoBuzz was a relationship intelligence service that would deliver news to your inbox when your important contacts or their companies were mentioned in online news sources. It had some other fancy features to differentiate it from Google Alerts, Gist, etc. such as NLP NER tagging, and calendar and CRM integration. We were in business from Early 2009 to late 2010.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Reason #1: Killing the product</strong></div>
<p />
<div>The biggest reason we "failed" is because we shut down the product and closed our doors. It's difficult to build a product that doesn't exist, and while this might seem like an obvious point, I think it's worth dwelling on. One can always look back and say "what if" ad nauseam. &nbsp;However, it's very probable we hopped off the roller coaster right at the bottom of the biggest drop. I think we should have rode it until it crashed and we were confirmed dead. It's a testament to the experience we have gained in the last year since shutting down that we can look back and see obvious problems that weren't apparent to us then. Maybe we would have never navigated past them, but we will never know.</div>
<p />
<div>You can't build a product you stop building.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Reason #2: Big dreams, conservative spending</strong></div>
<p />
<div>From the start, GoBuzz wanted to be the best relationship intelligence tool for busy teams. We relied solely on direct sales, and depended on contracts from small businesses and Fortune 100 companies.</div>
<p />
<div>Unfortunately, this was a huge time sink for a team of two full time employees with no formal funding and no direct sales experience. We always hoped for the big home run, the contract that would all but guarantee our ultimate dominance of the relationship intelligence space. Unfortunately, it never happened, and even if it had I doubt we could have scaled it (this was also Y Combinator's biggest stated concern with our business).</div>
<p />
<div>In truth, our product was a hard sell for our target users. It required sharing intimate contact knowledge (surprisingly the smallest hurdle), legal red-tape, a strong enough value proposition for the business and the stakeholders to spend time and money on, and too much customer attention to tweak results and contact information.</div>
<p />
<div>It's possible that if we focused on customer acquisition through online advertising, we may have had more users and customers, but we completely neglected this avenue. It's a running debate between my co-founder and I whether focusing on advertising instead of direct sales would have helped us. &nbsp;I believe it would have let us test the product with more users sooner, focus on metrics rather than unnecessary features, and not rely on awkward contracts from friends. It would have also helped us not take things so personally. Tweaking stats is a lot nicer than tweaking a single customer's reservations about your product.</div>
<p />
<div>We could have spent more money to hit direct sales or advertising harder, but we were too conservative. It's hard to grow a business if you are afraid of spending money.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Reason #3: Lacking confidence</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Throughout the almost two years GoBuzz was active, we had four or five MVPs. &nbsp;Yet, we immediately pivoted after each one without really giving it the chance it deserved. I think we just didn't know what GoBuzz was and didn't trust we could take our dream and make it a reality.</div>
<p />
<div>Part of this was our habit of listening to too many voices, and not focusing on the most important ones: our advisors' and our own. As a young startup, everyone has ideas for how you can grab hold of success and build your business. &nbsp;Unfortunately, only you and your mentors know which ones make sense for you to pursue considering the accumulated knowledge you have of the space, the time you've already spent on the product, and the direction you dream and plan of going.</div>
<p />
<div>We tacked on many features instead of growing our business because we thought all these suggestions and criticisms indicated that we had a shitty product. Since we let this go to our head, we always felt behind and that we would never have a product users would respect and enjoy using.</div>
<p />
<div>In reality, GoBuzz had some small but useful and consistent features. &nbsp;Sure, they weren't perfect, but I think they were good enough to focus on selling them instead of fixing them.</div>
<p />
<div>In addition, had we felt more confident about our product, we might have shown more devotion by attempting to raise money and to truly give it our all.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Reason #4: Working on the wrong things</strong></div>
<p />
<div>Frankly, I fell into the programmer's trap of coding too much. I thought coding would save the company. Conversely, I thought every bug would be the next one to kill the company.</div>
<p />
<div>This wore us down, kept us in the office longer each day, and kept us from spending time on metrics and growth.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Reason #5: We didn't enjoy running the business</strong></div>
<p />
<div>We didn't enjoy the lifestyle we had created for our business, and it wore us down after awhile. We were never even close to a semblance of harmony with the business and our real lives. &nbsp;It was exhausting and inefficient.</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Conclusion</strong></div>
<p />
<div>While I don't know if these conclusions are completely accurate, I feel confident that my next business will be harder fought, more efficient, more enjoyable, and more successful because I've failed before. &nbsp;I don't regret GoBuzz one bit and each time I think back on what went wrong <em>and</em> what went right, I perform better on my current projects. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>I hope any readers can share their insight to see if there is something I'm missing or incorrectly analyzing.&nbsp;</div>
