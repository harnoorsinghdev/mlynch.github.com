<p class="meta">24 May 2012 - Madison</p>

These last few weeks have been insanely hectic for me. In fact, I've really not gotten much programming work done at all on [Codiqa](http://codiqa.com/), though it really needs it. I just had to deal with a lot of ancillary stuff this last month.

When I haven't coded much I get in a really shitty mood, and I feel like I've been really unproductive. So, to snap out of it I decided to just fix a few nagging bugs with Codiqa and I feel ten times better than I did earlier today.

What I did tonight to get myself back in the groove:

* Fixed an annoying bug with the initial size and position of our properties popup dialog
* Started working on our Chrome Web Store package
* Tried Mixpanel again and successfully integrated it and figured out a decent initial metric to track (projects opened)
* Took out our KissMetrics code temporarily, trying to decide between the two
* Responded to a few forum posts referencing Codiqa that I found with Mixpanel's streaming view
* Responded to a customer I completely forgot to respond to on our support system (Freshdesk)
